	abstract = {Itch, the unpleasant sensation that elicits a desire to scratch, is mediated by specific subtypes of cutaneous sensory neuron. Here, we identify a subpopulation of itch-sensing neurons based on their expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret. We apply flow cytometry to isolate Ret-positive neurons from dorsal root ganglia and detected a distinct population marked by low levels of Ret and absence of isolectin B4 binding. We determine the transcriptional profile of these neurons and demonstrate that they express neuropeptides such as somatostatin (Sst), the NGF receptor TrkA, and multiple transcripts associated with itch. We validate the selective expression of Sst using an Sst-Cre driver line and ablated these neurons by generating mice in which the diphtheria toxin receptor is conditionally expressed from the sensory neuron-specific Avil locus. Sst-Cre::Avil(iDTR) mice display normal nociceptive responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli. However, scratching behavior evoked by interleukin-31 (IL-31) or agonist at the 5HT1F receptor is significantly reduced. Our data provide a molecular signature for a subpopulation of neurons activated by multiple pruritogens.},

	abstract = {Two ETS transcription factors of the Pea3 subfamily are induced in subpopulations of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory and spinal motor neurons by target-derived factors. Their expression controls late aspects of neuronal differentiation such as target invasion and branching. Here, we show that the late onset of ETS gene expression is an essential requirement for normal sensory neuron differentiation. We provide genetic evidence in the mouse that precocious ETS expression in DRG sensory neurons perturbs axonal projections, the acquisition of terminal differentiation markers, and their dependence on neurotrophic support. Together, our findings indicate that DRG sensory neurons exhibit a temporal developmental switch that can be revealed by distinct responses to ETS transcription factor signaling at sequential steps of neuronal maturation.},

However, a strong and universally responding system to express genes under Cre control is still lacking. We have generated a set of Cre reporter mice with strong, ubiquitous expression of fluorescent proteins of different spectra. The robust native fluorescence of these reporters enables direct visualization of fine dendritic structures and axonal projections of the labeled neurons, which is useful in mapping neuronal circuitry, imaging and tracking specific cell populations in vivo. Using these reporters and a high-throughput in situ hybridization platform, we are systematically profiling Cre-directed gene expression throughout the mouse brain in several Cre-driver lines, including new Cre lines targeting different cell types in the cortex. Our expression data are displayed in a public online database to help researchers assess the utility of various Cre-driver lines for cell-type-specific genetic manipulation.},

@article{Takeoka2019,
	abstract = {Somatosensory feedback from proprioceptive afferents (PAs) is essential for locomotor recovery after spinal cord injury. To determine where or when proprioception is required for locomotor recovery after injury, we established an intersectional genetic model for PA ablation with spatial and temporal confinement. We found that complete or spatially restricted PA ablation in intact mice differentially affects locomotor performance. Following incomplete spinal cord injury, PA ablation below but not above the lesion severely restricts locomotor recovery and descending circuit reorganization. Furthermore, ablation of PAs after behavioral recovery permanently reverts functional improvements, demonstrating their essential role for maintaining regained locomotor function despite the presence of reorganized descending circuits. In parallel to recovery, PAs undergo reorganization of activity-dependent synaptic connectivity to specific local spinal targets. Our study reveals that PAs interacting with local spinal circuits serve as a continued driving force to initiate and maintain locomotor output after injury.},

@article{Sousa2009,
	abstract = {Ventral telencephalic progenitors expressing the homeodomain transcription factor Nkx6-2 have been shown to give rise to a multitude of cortical interneuron subtypes usually associated with origin in either the medial ganglionic eminence or the caudal ganglionic eminence. The function of Nkx6-2 in directing the fate of those progenitors has, however, not been thoroughly analyzed. We used a combination of genetic inducible fate mapping and in vivo loss-of-function to analyze the requirement of Nkx6-2 in determining the fate of cortical interneurons. We have found that interneuron subtypes are born with a characteristic temporal pattern. Furthermore, we extend the characterization of interneurons from the Nkx6-2 lineage through the application of electrophysiological methods. Analysis of these populations in Nkx6-2 null mice suggests that there is a small and partially penetrant loss of delayed non-fast spiking somatostatin/calretinin double positive cortical interneurons in the absence of Nkx6-2 gene function.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Terrestrial locomotion is thought to be generated by the actions of a circuit of interconnected interneurons (central pattern generator) in the spinal cord that drive the patterned activity of pools of motor neurons, causing sequential contraction of dozens of leg muscles. Sensory feedback exerts a strong modulatory influence on this pattern; nevertheless, it remains unclear whether sensory feedback also plays a role in the generation of the normal locomotor pattern. Through the use of a combination of electrophysiology, behavior, and mouse genetics, we provide evidence that the absence of proprioceptive sensory feedback degrades locomotor pattern, indicating that proprioceptive feedback is required for the construction of locomotor pattern.
          , 
            Mammalian locomotor programs are thought to be directed by the actions of spinal interneuron circuits collectively referred to as {\textquotedblleft}central pattern generators.{\textquotedblright} The contribution of proprioceptive sensory feedback to the coordination of locomotor activity remains less clear. We have analyzed changes in mouse locomotor pattern under conditions in which proprioceptive feedback is attenuated genetically and biomechanically. We find that locomotor pattern degrades upon elimination of proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The degradation of locomotor pattern is manifest as the loss of interjoint coordination and alternation of flexor and extensor muscles. Group Ia/II sensory feedback from muscle spindles has a predominant influence in patterning the activity of flexor muscles, whereas the redundant activities of group Ia/II and group Ib afferents appear to determine the pattern of extensor muscle firing. These findings establish a role for proprioceptive feedback in the control of fundamental aspects of mammalian locomotor behavior.},

@article{Akay2023,
	abstract = { Among all daily activities, walking accounts for the highest proportion of falls in the elderly (24%), and falls occur more often in the lateral direction (Robinovitch et al., 2013). The compromised proprioceptive and tactile sensation due to aging or illness contributes to falls, although precise mechanisms are not well understood. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of mechanosensory cutaneous information for maintaining lateral stability in humans (Meyer et al., 2004) and cats (Park et al., 2019), but the role of proprioception remains obscure. Mice provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of proprioception in controlling lateral locomotor stability due to advances in genetic engineering. Crouched locomotion and small size might prevent mice from loosing balance during locomotion even after major disruptions of proprioceptive feedback (Akay et al., 2014) and vestibular function (Murray et al., 2018), whereas larger species like cats and humans experience much greater balance deficits after losing somatosensory feedback (Stapley et al., 2002; Cole, Paillard, 1998). It is still unclear if, how and to what extent mice rely on proprioceptive sensory feedback to maintain lateral stability during locomotion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of muscle length-dependent sensory feedback in control of lateral stability during mouse locomotion. We hypothesized that mice lacking the muscle spindles modify locomotor posture and frontal plane kinematics to maintain lateral stability; i.e., muscle spindle afferents participate in regulation of lateral stability of normal mouse locomotion. We determined measures of lateral stability during treadmill locomotion at different speeds in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that lack proprioceptive muscle spindle feedback, the Egr3 knock out mice (Egr3-KO, Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998). The measures of lateral stability were calculated using the positions of the center of mass (COM), labeled with a marker on the body, and paws recorded by a high-speed video system while animals were locomoting on a transparent treadmill with a mirror underneath. We show that mice without muscle spindle feedback assume a lower body posture. The COM lateral position fluctuates in Egr3-KO mice as much as in WT. The hindlimb step width is lower in Eg3-KO mice than in WT, whereas the forelimb step width is similar. Changes in the height of the body, step width, and lateral CoM fluctuation led to similar measures of lateral stability in WT and Egr3-KO mice during locomotion. We also found correlation between the lateral COM shifts in individual walking cycles with the change in lateral position of the ipsilateral paws in the subsequent cycles regardless of the presence of muscle spindle feedback. In addition, we show that changes in the lateral stability measures in response to sudden and random lateral displacement perturbations in WT and Egr3-KO mice were very similar. Since locomotor adaptations of Egr3-KO mice lead to similar lateral stability measures as in the WT mice, we conclude that muscle spindle afferents participate in regulation of lateral stability during normal locomotion.},

	abstract = {Key points Locomotion on land and in water requires the coordination of a great number of muscle activations and joint movements. Constant feedback about the position of own body parts in relation to the surrounding environment and the body itself (proprioception) is required to maintain stability and avoid failure. The central nervous system may follow a modular type of organization by controlling muscles in orchestrated groups (muscle synergies) rather than individually. We used this concept on genetically modified mice lacking muscle spindles, one of the two main classes of proprioceptors. We provide evidence that proprioceptive feedback is required by the central nervous system to accurately tune the modular organization of locomotion. Abstract For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback information (e.g. proprioception), make the task of controlling movement a problem with overabundant degrees of freedom. It is widely accepted that the central nervous system may simplify the creation and control of movement by generating activation patterns common to muscle groups, rather than specific to individual muscles. These activation patterns, called muscle synergies, describe the modular organization of movement. We extracted synergies through electromyography from the hind limb muscle activities of wild-type and genetically modified mice lacking sensory feedback from muscle spindles. Muscle spindle-deficient mice underwent a modification of the temporal structure (motor primitives) of muscle synergies that resulted in diminished functionality during walking. In addition, both the temporal and spatial (motor modules) components of synergies were severely affected when external perturbations were introduced or when animals were immersed in water. These findings show that sensory feedback from group Ia/II muscle spindles regulates motor function in normal and perturbed walking. Moreover, when group Ib Golgi tendon organ feedback is lacking due to enhanced buoyancy, the modular organization of swimming is almost completely compromised.},

	abstract = {Robust locomotion relies on information from proprioceptors: sensory organs that communicate the position of body parts to the spinal cord and brain. Proprioceptive circuits in the spinal cord are known to coarsely regulate locomotion in the presence of perturbations. Yet, the regulatory importance of the brain in maintaining robust locomotion remains less clear. Here, through mouse genetic studies and in vivo electrophysiology, we examined the role of the brain in integrating proprioceptive information during perturbed locomotion. The systemic removal of proprioceptors left the mice in a constantly perturbed state, similar to that observed during mechanically perturbed locomotion in wild-type mice and characterised by longer and less accurate synergistic activation patterns. By contrast, after surgically interrupting the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brain through the dorsal column of the spinal cord, wild-type mice showed normal walking behaviour, yet lost the ability to respond to external perturbations. Our findings provide direct evidence of a pivotal role for ascending proprioceptive information in achieving robust, safe locomotion. Key points Whether brain integration of proprioceptive feedback is crucial for coping with perturbed locomotion is not clear. We showed a crucial role of the brain for responding to external perturbations and ensure robust locomotion. We used mouse genetics to remove proprioceptors and a spinal lesion model to interrupt the flow of proprioceptive information to the brain through the dorsal column in wild-type animals. Using a custom-built treadmill, we administered sudden and random mechanical perturbations to mice during walking. External perturbations affected locomotion in wild-type mice similar to the absence of proprioceptors in genetically modified mice. Proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs contributed to locomotor robustness. Wild-type mice lost the ability to respond to external perturbations after interruption of the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brainstem.},

Postural stability was measured as anteroposterior torque variance in Young (n = 25, average age = 25.1 years) and Elderly subjects (n = 16, average age = 71.5 years) during repeated calf vibrations while standing with eyes open and closed. Sensation, recorded using vibration perception and tactile sensitivity, was poorer in elderly than young subjects. Sensation was of low importance for stability during quiet stance and the first 50 s of repeated vibrations, but was associated with stability during the last three 50 s periods of balance perturbations, suggesting that the mechanoreceptive sensation affected how well postural control could adapt to repeated balance perturbations. The findings suggest that clinicians should investigate whether patients with balance problems and poor adaptation have mechanoreceptive sensation deficits.},

If ageing compromises these sensorimotor functions of muscle, the ability of older subjects to detect and correct postural sway may be impeded, resulting in impairment of functional performance.Method: to see if age-related changes occurred and, if so, what their effects might be. Quadriceps strength, proprioception, postural stability and functional performance were assessed in young (n = 20, mean age 23 years), middle-aged (n = 10, mean age 56 years) and elderly (n = 15, mean age 72 years) subjects.Results: with increasing age there were decreases in quadriceps strength (r = -0.511; P \&lt; 0.001), acuity of joint position sense (r = -0.603; P \&lt; 0.001) and postural stability (ANOVA \&lt; 0.002) during stance conditions which placed a greater reliance on muscle proprioceptors. These changes may decrease postural stability confidence, resulting in impaired performance of common activities of daily living (r = 0.635; P \&lt; 0.001).Conclusions: the age-related deterioration in sensorimotor function of muscle may contribute to the increased fear and frequency of falls in elderly subjects, thereby decreasing independence.},

Walking speed, stride length and cadence declined with age with corresponding increases in stance duration and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, tactile and vibration sense in the lower limb, vestibular function (as assessed by the vestibular X Writing Test), quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength and reaction time were significantly associated with all five gait parameters. Postural sway measures were associated with walking speed, stride length and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Multiple regression analyses revealed seven sensori-motor measures as significant predictors for one or more of the gait parameters: low contrast visual acuity, tactile sensitivity, vibration sense, vestibular X-test writing performance, quadriceps strength, reaction time and sway. Quadriceps strength was included as a predictor variable for every gait parameter and in each case had the strongest beta weight. Women who fell on two or more occasions in a one-year prospective period had significantly reduced and more variable cadence and significantly increased stance duration (measured in absolute terms and as a percentage of stride) than those who did not fall or fell on one occasion only. The study findings elucidate the relative importance of specific physiological systems in the maintenance of normal gait and identify temporal gait measures that are associated with falling in older people.},
