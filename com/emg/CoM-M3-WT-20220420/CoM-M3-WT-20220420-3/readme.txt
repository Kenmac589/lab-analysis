In this study, we made use of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to extract muscle synergies from electromyographic (EMG) data. We implemented the NMF algorithm in R version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), a programming language available in a free software environment. However, even if the software does not require a paid license, often researchers are either not confident with or prefer not to spend time writing the code required to perform NMF. We make available, as we recently did with human data (Santuz et al., 2018), an example open access data set of EMG and muscle synergy data for murine walking and swimming. The data presented in this supplementary information part is available in three formats: 1) the raw EMG of two example trials (one recorded during walking and the other during swimming in a wild type animal, six muscles), unprocessed together with the touchdown and lift-off timings of the recorded limb for walking and the cycle timings for swimming; 2) the filtered and time-normalized EMG and 3) the muscle synergies extracted via NMF. Moreover, we provide the R code for obtaining the results described in the previous three points. We do not report any metadata, since trials are relative to a single representative animal. The R code is profusely commented. Gait cycle parameters The files containing the walking and swimming cycle breakdown are available in ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. The files are structured as data frames with as many rows as the number of available cycles and two columns. The first column of the walking trial contains the touchdown incremental times in seconds. The second column contains the duration of each stance phase in seconds. The only column of the swimming trial contains the starting times of each cycle. Each trial is saved both as a single ASCII file and as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “CYCLE_TIMES_A0001_W”, where the characters “CYCLE_TIMES” indicate that the trial contains the walking or swimming cycle breakdown times, the characters “A0001” indicate the animal number (in this example the first) and the last character indicates the type of locomotion (“W” for walking and “S” for swimming). SI 2 EMG data The files containing the raw, filtered and the normalized EMG data are available in ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. The raw EMG files are structured as data frames with as many rows as the recorded data points and seven columns. The first column contains the incremental time in seconds. The remaining six columns contain the raw EMG data, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section of this paper (note that in these examples, only six muscles are presented, see methods). Each trial is saved both as a single ASCII file and as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “RAW_EMG_A0001_W”, where the characters “RAW_EMG” indicate that the trial contains raw emg data, the characters “A0001” indicate the animal number (in this example the first) and the last character indicates the type of locomotion (“W” for walking and “S” for swimming). The filtered and time-normalized emg data is named, following the same rules, like “FILT_EMG_A0001_W”. Muscle synergies The files containing the muscle synergies extracted from the filtered and normalized EMG data are available in ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. The muscle synergies files are divided in motor primitives and motor modules and are presented as direct output of the factorization and not in any functional order. Motor primitives are data frames with a number of rows equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial) and a number of columns equal to the number of cycles times 200 points (see methods). The rows contain the time-dependent coefficients (motor primitives), one row for each synergy (named e.g. “Syn1, Syn2, Syn3”, where “Syn” is the abbreviation for “synergy”). Each gait cycle contains 200 data points, which in walking are divided in 100 for the stance and 100 for the swing phase. Each set of motor primitives relative to one synergy is saved both as a single ASCII file and as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “SYNS_H_P0026_02”, where the characters “SYNS_H” indicate that the trial contains motor primitive data, the characters “A0001” indicate the animal number (in this example the first) and the last character indicates the type of locomotion (“W” for walking and “S” for swimming). Motor modules are data frames with as many rows as the number of considered muscles (seven in this example) and a number of columns equal to the number of synergies (which might differ from trial to trial). The rows, named with muscle abbreviations that follow those reported in the methods section of this paper, contain the time-independent coefficients (motor modules), one for each synergy and for each muscle. Each set of motor modules relative to one synergy is saved both as a single ASCII file and as an element of a single R list. Trials are named like “SYNS_W_A0001_W”, where the characters “SYNS_W” indicate that the trial contains motor module data, the characters “A0001” indicate the animal number (in this example the first) and the last character indicates the type of locomotion (“W” for walking and “S” for swimming). Since they are time-invariant coefficients, motor modules are usually represented with bar graphs. On the contrary, motor primitives describe the evolution over time of the basic activation patterns and are therefore better represented with time-dependent curves. When multiplying and summing synergy-by-synergy the elements of the two matrices W (motor modules) and H (motor primitives), it is possible to reconstruct the original set of EMG data. Code All the code used for the preprocessing of EMG data and the extraction of muscle synergies is available in R (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. Explanatory comments are profusely present throughout the scripts (“SYNS.R”, which is the main script and “fun_synsNMFn.R”, which contains the NMF function). Supplementary data set (separate file) The supplementary data set contains data from two example trials, one recorded during walking and the second during swimming in a wild type animal. The raw and the filtered and time-normalized EMG activities are available in both ASCII and RData (R Found. for Stat. Comp.) format. The same goes for the synergy data and the cycle times (useful to normalize the EMG data). All the R code that can be used to extract synergies from this kind of EMG data is included as well.
