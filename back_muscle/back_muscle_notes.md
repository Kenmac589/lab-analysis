# Notes for Analysis on back muscle project

- To get the waveform correlation view that Turgay showed.
    1. Analysis -> New Results View -> Waveform Correlation
    2. Select the 8 EMG channels and have the Right IP as the reference
    3. Set Width to 0.8
    4. Set Offset to 0.4
    5. Set the range based on two cursors, which I've placed based on the presence of treadmill speed to indicate recording.
