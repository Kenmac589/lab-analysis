# Relating to xCoM

- In the file I worked on with Turgay the equation has
    - Ch(6006) + (Ch(37) / Sqrt(9.81/0.02777))
    - Ch(6006) : Also a random channel Turgay made which is just the CoMy
    - Ch(37) : Is a smoothened and sloped version of CoMy
        - The smoothening factor applied here 0.02 (damn).
- For centre of pressure
    - For the right side it will be ((Ch(30) + Ch(35)) / 2) * Ch(60)
        - These are based on the y coordinates for these limbs
    - For the left side it would be ((Ch(33) + Ch(28)) / 2) * Ch(59)
- For double support
    - Forelimb sw of to hindlimb swon
    - level type of channel
    - import combined event event channel buffer into level
