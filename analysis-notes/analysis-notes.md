# Wild-type Controls

## WT 1

    - For non-perturbation @0.100, I used first recording
    - synergies to use: 3
    - For perturbation @0.100 I used recording starting at ~1067
    - synergies to use: 3


# For DTR Mice Series (4 month group)

**The 6 month DTR mice have some channels that are mixed around from the order of implantation in the 1 yr mice which is based on the spike configuration currently being used**
- For Gastrocnemius (Gs)
    - CoM: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
    - 6 month: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike
    - 1 year: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
- For Semitendinosus (St)
    - CoM: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike
    - 6 month: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
    - 1 year: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike


Here are the values in cm (first thigh and then shank):

# For pre DTX recordings:

M1: 1.5 -1.5
M2: 1.6 - 1.8
M3: 1.4 - 1.6
M5: 1.5 - 1.8

For post DTX recordings:

M1: 1.4 -1.6
M2: 1.5 - 1.6
M3: 1.4 - 1.7
M5: 1.4 - 1.7

## Working Through Files

[recording_summary](../com/dtr/dtr-6-months/recording_summary.csv)

**Turgay is planning on redoing all the 4 month group**

- [X] M5-pre
- [X] M5-post

# First Committee Meeting Analysis

- Looking at 6m-M5-preDTX
    - First sinusoidal at 0.100 is broken into parts of constant stimulation and a full recording as well
    - Second sinusoidal at 0.400 much better looking in terms of just being cleaner
# Post Meeting Analysis

- Working through the wild type mice
