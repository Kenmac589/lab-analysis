# Notes from EMG analysis

- This for notes regarding what I am noticing while doing Electromyography (EMG) analysis.

## WT 1

    - For non-perturbation @0.100, I used first recording
    - synergies to use: 3
    - For perturbation @0.100 I used recording starting at ~1067
    - synergies to use: 3

## WT 4

- I used first non-perturbation recording and the perturbation recording starts at around 1205

# For DTR Mice Series (4 month group)

**The 6 month DTR mice have some channels that are mixed around from the order of implantation in the 1 yr mice which is based on the spike configuration currently being used**
- For Gastrocnemius (Gs)
    - CoM: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
    - 6 month: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike
    - 1 year: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
- For Semitendinosus (St)
    - CoM: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike
    - 6 month: muscle 7, channel 10 in spike
    - 1 year: muscle 5, channel 8 in spike
