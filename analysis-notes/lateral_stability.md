# Lateral Stability

- One method for assessing stability is the **static margin of stability**: The distance from the vertical projection of the body center-of-mass (CoM) to the closest paw/foot on the ground.
- However, the main thing that I am calculating with Turgay at the moment is the

> We also computed the margin of lateral dynamic stability (MoS) as the
distance between the xCoM peak and the CoP at the onset of the ipsilateral double support
phase in each cycle (Park et al., 2019)


    - This is much smaller in quadrupeds (= less stable).
- The measurement of dynamic stability (MoS) is the shortest distance between the xCoM and the CoP.
