# Lateral Stability

- One method for assessing stability is the **static margin of stability**: The distance from the vertical projection of the body center-of-mass (CoM) to the closest paw/foot on the ground.
    - This is much smaller in quadrupeds (= less stable).
- The measurement of dynamic stability (MoS) is the shortest distance between the xCoM and the CoP.
