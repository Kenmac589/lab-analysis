**These selections were made based on normalized data with spike script that had an error**

For predtx without perturbation
- Synergies: 5
For predtx with perturbation
- Synergies: 5
For postdtx without perturbation
- Synergies: 4
    - Maybe 3
For postdtx with perturbation
- Synergies: 4
    - maybe 3

## CoM-M1

- For non-perturbation @0.100, I used first recording
    - synergies to use: 3
- For perturbation @0.100 I used recording starting at ~1067
    - synergies to use: 3

## For DTR-M5

for perturbation at 0.100 used recording around 1290

- preDTX non 0.100: 4 synergies
- preDTX per 0.100: 
- postDTX non 0.100:
- postDTX non 0.100:
