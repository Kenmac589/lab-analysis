# Notes from Kinematic analysis

- This for notes regarding what I am noticing while doing kinematic analysis.

# Hip Height

[hip_heights](hip_heights.md)

# Measurement of Dynamic Lateral Stability (MoS)

NOTE: Really important information on certain data files that are problematic.
- Review:
    - wt-2-non
    - wt-1-per
    - wt-2-per
    - wt-2-sin
    - egr3-7-non
    - egr3-7-per
    - egr3-8-per
- General trends seem to be the same


## Egr3 and WT sets

- Mostly already done, however, I'm using extra channels to clean some stuff up.

- Going over the possibly affected data files
    - So far there is
    - By the looks of it, all of them with perturbation and sinusoidal
        - [X] Perturbation and sinus for egr 10
            - Noting that for the perturbation, despite overlap, it's during a stimulation, mouse must of stumbled.
        - [X] Perturbation and sinus for egr 9
            - Added a second perturbation recording under cursors 7 to 8
                - related export is the first of the perturbation ones
                - other is between 3-4
        - [X] Perturbation and sinus for egr 8
        - [X] Perturbation and sinus for egr 7
        - [X] Perturbation and sinus for egr 6
        - [X] Definitely check all the WT's
            - [X] WT 1
            - [X] WT 2
            - [X] WT 3
            - [X] WT 4
            - [X] WT 5

- Seeing some weird stuff with the Egr3-7 mouse check videos
- NOTE: WT M2 and Egr3 M7 are kind of looking sketchy imo.

## For the DTR set

NOTE: For the sw on and offset channels are only cleaned for conditions I will be using. Don't just go ahead and think they are cleaned and can go to the server.

### DTR-M1

- Not really useable as there is nothing for any perturbation for the preDTX.

### DTR-M2

- Even non-perturbation for DTR-M2 is shit but kind of salvageable.

### DTR-M6-8

### Kinematics for DTR M6-M8

- M6-preDTX-000019 video is fairly poor, so keep that in mind in terms of the model performance.
    
- PreDTX
    - M6:
        - Length of thigh: 1.5
        - Length of shank: 1.5
    - M7:
        - Length of thigh: 1.2
        - Length of shank: 1.4
- PostDTX
    - M6:
        - Length of thigh: 1.4
        - Length of shank: 1.6
    - M7:
        - Length of thigh: 1.4
        - Length of shank: 1.6
    - M8:
        - Length of thigh: 1.4
        - Length of shank: 1.6

- There are really no valid recordings for perturbation or sinusoidal conditions.
