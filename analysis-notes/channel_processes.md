# Channel Processes

A channel process is an operation, for example rectification, applied dynamically to data channels. The original data is not changed, but all users of the channel see data modified by the process. Multiple processes can be applied, for example DC removal then rectification then smoothing of a waveform channel or time shifting and de-bounce of an event channel. Every time you use the data, the processing is applied, so using a processed channel is slower than using raw data. If a channel has an attached process, the channel number is displayed in red.

Before Spike2 9.02, channel processes could be applied to Waveform and RealWave channels only. Now you can apply processes to any channel type, but note that some processes are specific to waveform data and some to event data.

If a channel is already part of an analysis operation, such as a waveform average, adding a process and continuing the analysis may generate incorrect results. This is particularly the case with processes that change the sample rate or interpretation of waveform data. Restart the analysis operation to ensure correct results.

To add a process, open the Channel Process command from the Analysis menu and select a Channel or right-click the target channel and select Channel Process. The list to the left of the Apply button shows processes to apply in order. Editable values for the selected process are displayed on the left of the dialog. Clear removes all processes from the channel. Add appends a new process set by the drop down list to the left of the Add button to the end of the list. Delete removes the selected process. When recording is enabled, Apply copies changed argument values to the process and records the script to make the change, otherwise changes are applied immediately.

Some processes have arguments that you can edit. Unless you have script recording turned on, changes made by editing are applied immediately. The spinner buttons next to the value adjust the value by the smallest useful change, or by 1% of the current value, whichever is the larger.

If you have multiple processes, you can change the order by clicking on a process in the list and dragging it to a new position.

## Selected channels

You can copy all the processes set for the current channel to other channels. Select the target channels by clicking their channel numbers (usually on the left edge of the time view) and click the CopyTo button. You can only copy processes to a channel that is capable of applying the current process list.

You can also clear any all channel processes from any selected channels. In the example image, the only channel capable applying the list of processes is channel 1, which is the source channel, so no channels show up in the CopyTo list. However, channel 2 (an event channel), does hold a process, so it can be cleared.

## Restrictions caused by processing

Some processes change waveform channel scales and offsets (these are the values that translate between a 16-bit integer representation of a waveform and user units). Such changes do not affect the data on disk and are removed when the process is removed. The Calibrate dialog and the Channel Information dialog will not allow you to change the channel calibration if an attached process has changed the channel scale or offset. You are not allowed to calibrate a RealWave channel that has any attached channel process.

## Process types
You can add processes of the following types: Rectify, Smooth, DC Remove, Slope, Time shift, Down sample, Interpolate, Match channel, RMS amplitude, Median filter, Fill gaps, No Nan, Debounce.

## Recording actions and the Rec button

If you turn script recording on in the script menu, the dialog behaviour changes and edits you make to arguments are not applied and recorded until you click the Apply button. This is so that we do not fill the recorded script up with every single change you make. Recordings made this way record each action, so adding a smoothing process is recorded in two parts: adding the smoothing process, then setting the desired time constant.

The Rec button is normally hidden and only appears when you enable script recording. If you click Rec, the channel process state is recorded neatly in an easy to understand way with all the argument values on one line. If you want to see the shortest script sequence to create your current channel processes do the following:

1. With script recording off, set up the processes you want in the dialog.
2. Turn script recording on in the Script menu
3. The Rec button will appear, click it.
4. Turn script recording off

## Rectify (wave)

This replaces all negative input values with positive values of the same magnitude. There are no additional arguments required to define this process. This is a non-linear process, in the sense that the output is not related to the input by a transform of the form output = scale * input +offset. This process changes the channel offset to ensure that the full range of the rectified data can be expressed in a Waveform channel. The result of Rectify on a Waveform channel can be limited if the channel has a non-zero offset.

## Smooth (wave)

This process has one argument, a time period in seconds, p. The output at time t is the average value of the input data points from time t-p to t+p seconds. This process does not affect the channel scale or offset. More about smoothing.

## DC Remove (wave)

This process has one argument, a time period in seconds, p. The output at time t is the input value at time t minus the average value of the input data points from time t-p to t+p, that is, it is equivalent to the original signal minus the result of the smoothing operation, described above. Â This process does not affect the channel scale, but the channel offset is set to zero.

## Slope (wave)

This process has one argument, a time period in seconds, p. The slope at time t is calculated using an equal weighting of the points from time t-p to t+p. This is done by calculating the mean of the points ahead and the mean of the points behind each data point, and the slope is taken from the line through the centre of the points behind to the centre of the points ahead. This calculation is equivalent to applying an FIR filter, it is not a least squares fit through the points. This method is used because it can be applied iteratively very efficiently to a long run of data. If you apply this process to a channel, the channel scale, offset and units change. If the current channels units are no more than 3 characters long, "/s" is added to them, so units of "V" become units of "V/s". If there is not sufficient space, the final character of the units becomes "!" to indicate that the units are no longer correct. The offset becomes 0, and the scale changes to generate the correct units.

## Time shift (any channel)

This process has one argument, the time to shift the data. A positive time shifts the data into the future (to the right); a negative time shifts the data into the past. To preserve waveform timing but change the positions where the data was sampled, use the Interpolate or Match channel processes. Beware using negative time shifts online as this will attempt to shift data that does not yet exist, which can cause drawing and data processing problems.

## Down sample (wave)

This process changes the sample rate of the wave by taking one point in n. There is one argument, prompted by Use one point in, which is the down sample ratio. You might want to use this command after filtering or smoothing a waveform. This is a faster operation than Interpolate.

## Interpolate (wave)

You can change the sample rate of a channel and set the time of the first data point with this process. Interpolation is by cubic spline of the original data. No data is generated outside the time range of the original data points. Interpolation is not too slow, but if you increase the sampling rate it will take longer to draw and process data.

The first argument, Sample interval, is the time in seconds between output data points. You can type in expressions here so, to set 123 Hz, type 1/123. The actual interval is set as close to the requested one as possible (given the time resolution of the file). When you create the channel process, this is set to the current sample interval of the channel.

The second argument, Align to, aligns the output data to a time. It must be positive. The process places data points at this time plus and minus multiples of the sample interval. You can use this to convert multi-channel data sampled by a 1401 into simultaneously sampled data by giving all the channels the same alignment and sample rate.

Cubic spline interpolation assumes that the input waveform and its first and second differentials are continuous. If the input data was suitably filtered this will be not too far from the truth. Not all data is suitable for cubic splining; splining across step changes generates ringing effects that were not present in the original signal.

Cubic spline interpolation is better than linear interpolation for continuous data, but it is not perfect. The graph shows the error between a sine wave sampled with 20 points per cycle and splined to 80 points per cycle and a calculated 80 points per cycle sine wave. The maximum error is small, in this case 0.0000255 of the original signal (compared to 0.003 for linear interpolation). However, the maximum error increases rapidly the fewer points there are per cycle of the original data. With 5 points per cycle, the maximum interpolation error for a sinusoid is almost 1 per cent of the original signal (compared to 19% for linear interpolation). 

## Match channel (wave)

This is the same as Interpolate, except that the sample interval and alignment are copied from a nominated channel. The initial channel is set to the current channel, so adding this process should have no visible effect (apart from causing a redraw).

## RMS amplitude (wave)

This process has one argument, a time period in seconds, p. The output at time t is the RMS value of the input data points from time t-p to t+p seconds. For waveform data, the output may be limited by the 16-bit nature of the data if the channel offset is very large compared to the scale factor.

## Median filter (wave)

This process has one argument, a time period in seconds, p. The output at time t is the median value of the input data points from time t-p to t+p seconds. The median is the middle point after the data has been sorted into order. This can be useful if your data has occasional points with large errors. This filter is slow if p spans a large number of data points; set the time period to the smallest value that removes the outlier points. You may find it better to use this method to identify outliers (for example by looking for large differences between raw and median-filtered data) and remove them by other methods (for example Linear Prediction) rather than using the results of the filter directly.

## Fill gaps (wave)

Waveform and RealWave channels can have gaps, where no data exists. This process guarantees that the channel has no gaps by filling in gaps greater than a specified time with a fixed level and by linearly interpolating across smaller gaps. There are two arguments: the maximum gap in a waveform to interpolate across and the level to use to fill gaps wider that the maximum gap. At the start and end, gaps less than the specified maximum are filled by duplicating the first or last data point. This is a non-linear process (see Rectify, above). To fill short gaps (especially those generated by the Skip NaN process) you could consider using Linear Prediction.

## Skip NaN (wave)

A NaN (Not a Number) is a floating point value that is either undefined in some way, or is infinite (the result of dividing by zero or an arithmetic overflow). These values can occur when RealWave data is imported into Spike2 (for example, some systems that transmit data over a link uses NaN to flag missing data values), or in a virtual channel if you divide by zero. This process removes such numbers from the channel, leaving gaps. Applying this process to a Waveform channel is a waste of processing time as Waveform channels (based on 16-bit integer data) can never hold invalid values. The process has no arguments. You may want to follow this process with the Fill gaps process to keep the data contiguous. Alternatively, you could consider using Linear Prediction to repair the damage by guessing the NaN values (in this case do not use Skip NaN and the NaN values will appear as if they were 0's).

## Debounce (event)

This process removes events that are too close to the previous event, usually caused by recording events from a mechanical switch. For all event-based channels except Level events, this process simple removes an event if the preceding one is closer than the Minimum interval (set in seconds). For example, if there are events at 10, 11, 12 and 13 milliseconds with none before and none after, if the minimum interval is set to anything greater than 1 millisecond, only the event at 10 milliseconds will remain. This is equivalent to the on-line event input debounce.

For Level event channels, intervals at or more than the Minimum interval from the previous edge are preserved, but if this results in a pulse (high or low) with a duration of less than the minimum interval, the pulse is removed.

In this example, the bottom trace (Events) has been duplicated and then de-bounced with a Minimum interval of 0.004 seconds (4 ms) in the second trace. All events with another event before them closer than 4 ms are removed. The third (Level) trace has also been duplicated and de-bounced with the same interval. The first group of events Get reduced to a pulse, the second group also get reduce to a pulse, which is then discarded as it lasts less than 4ms. The third and fourth groups become amalgamated into a single pulse as they are not separated by 4ms. The fifth and sixth groups are interpreted as a pulse with a noisy start and a noisy end.
