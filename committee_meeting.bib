	abstract = {Significance
            Terrestrial locomotion is thought to be generated by the actions of a circuit of interconnected interneurons (central pattern generator) in the spinal cord that drive the patterned activity of pools of motor neurons, causing sequential contraction of dozens of leg muscles. Sensory feedback exerts a strong modulatory influence on this pattern; nevertheless, it remains unclear whether sensory feedback also plays a role in the generation of the normal locomotor pattern. Through the use of a combination of electrophysiology, behavior, and mouse genetics, we provide evidence that the absence of proprioceptive sensory feedback degrades locomotor pattern, indicating that proprioceptive feedback is required for the construction of locomotor pattern.
          , 
            Mammalian locomotor programs are thought to be directed by the actions of spinal interneuron circuits collectively referred to as {\textquotedblleft}central pattern generators.{\textquotedblright} The contribution of proprioceptive sensory feedback to the coordination of locomotor activity remains less clear. We have analyzed changes in mouse locomotor pattern under conditions in which proprioceptive feedback is attenuated genetically and biomechanically. We find that locomotor pattern degrades upon elimination of proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The degradation of locomotor pattern is manifest as the loss of interjoint coordination and alternation of flexor and extensor muscles. Group Ia/II sensory feedback from muscle spindles has a predominant influence in patterning the activity of flexor muscles, whereas the redundant activities of group Ia/II and group Ib afferents appear to determine the pattern of extensor muscle firing. These findings establish a role for proprioceptive feedback in the control of fundamental aspects of mammalian locomotor behavior.},

@article{Akay2023,
	abstract = { Among all daily activities, walking accounts for the highest proportion of falls in the elderly (24%), and falls occur more often in the lateral direction (Robinovitch et al., 2013). The compromised proprioceptive and tactile sensation due to aging or illness contributes to falls, although precise mechanisms are not well understood. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of mechanosensory cutaneous information for maintaining lateral stability in humans (Meyer et al., 2004) and cats (Park et al., 2019), but the role of proprioception remains obscure. Mice provide an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the role of proprioception in controlling lateral locomotor stability due to advances in genetic engineering. Crouched locomotion and small size might prevent mice from loosing balance during locomotion even after major disruptions of proprioceptive feedback (Akay et al., 2014) and vestibular function (Murray et al., 2018), whereas larger species like cats and humans experience much greater balance deficits after losing somatosensory feedback (Stapley et al., 2002; Cole, Paillard, 1998). It is still unclear if, how and to what extent mice rely on proprioceptive sensory feedback to maintain lateral stability during locomotion. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of muscle length-dependent sensory feedback in control of lateral stability during mouse locomotion. We hypothesized that mice lacking the muscle spindles modify locomotor posture and frontal plane kinematics to maintain lateral stability; i.e., muscle spindle afferents participate in regulation of lateral stability of normal mouse locomotion. We determined measures of lateral stability during treadmill locomotion at different speeds in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that lack proprioceptive muscle spindle feedback, the Egr3 knock out mice (Egr3-KO, Tourtellotte and Milbrandt, 1998). The measures of lateral stability were calculated using the positions of the center of mass (COM), labeled with a marker on the body, and paws recorded by a high-speed video system while animals were locomoting on a transparent treadmill with a mirror underneath. We show that mice without muscle spindle feedback assume a lower body posture. The COM lateral position fluctuates in Egr3-KO mice as much as in WT. The hindlimb step width is lower in Eg3-KO mice than in WT, whereas the forelimb step width is similar. Changes in the height of the body, step width, and lateral CoM fluctuation led to similar measures of lateral stability in WT and Egr3-KO mice during locomotion. We also found correlation between the lateral COM shifts in individual walking cycles with the change in lateral position of the ipsilateral paws in the subsequent cycles regardless of the presence of muscle spindle feedback. In addition, we show that changes in the lateral stability measures in response to sudden and random lateral displacement perturbations in WT and Egr3-KO mice were very similar. Since locomotor adaptations of Egr3-KO mice lead to similar lateral stability measures as in the WT mice, we conclude that muscle spindle afferents participate in regulation of lateral stability during normal locomotion.},

@article{Santuz2019,
	abstract = {Key points Locomotion on land and in water requires the coordination of a great number of muscle activations and joint movements. Constant feedback about the position of own body parts in relation to the surrounding environment and the body itself (proprioception) is required to maintain stability and avoid failure. The central nervous system may follow a modular type of organization by controlling muscles in orchestrated groups (muscle synergies) rather than individually. We used this concept on genetically modified mice lacking muscle spindles, one of the two main classes of proprioceptors. We provide evidence that proprioceptive feedback is required by the central nervous system to accurately tune the modular organization of locomotion. Abstract For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback information (e.g. proprioception), make the task of controlling movement a problem with overabundant degrees of freedom. It is widely accepted that the central nervous system may simplify the creation and control of movement by generating activation patterns common to muscle groups, rather than specific to individual muscles. These activation patterns, called muscle synergies, describe the modular organization of movement. We extracted synergies through electromyography from the hind limb muscle activities of wild-type and genetically modified mice lacking sensory feedback from muscle spindles. Muscle spindle-deficient mice underwent a modification of the temporal structure (motor primitives) of muscle synergies that resulted in diminished functionality during walking. In addition, both the temporal and spatial (motor modules) components of synergies were severely affected when external perturbations were introduced or when animals were immersed in water. These findings show that sensory feedback from group Ia/II muscle spindles regulates motor function in normal and perturbed walking. Moreover, when group Ib Golgi tendon organ feedback is lacking due to enhanced buoyancy, the modular organization of swimming is almost completely compromised.},

	abstract = {Robust locomotion relies on information from proprioceptors: sensory organs that communicate the position of body parts to the spinal cord and brain. Proprioceptive circuits in the spinal cord are known to coarsely regulate locomotion in the presence of perturbations. Yet, the regulatory importance of the brain in maintaining robust locomotion remains less clear. Here, through mouse genetic studies and in vivo electrophysiology, we examined the role of the brain in integrating proprioceptive information during perturbed locomotion. The systemic removal of proprioceptors left the mice in a constantly perturbed state, similar to that observed during mechanically perturbed locomotion in wild-type mice and characterised by longer and less accurate synergistic activation patterns. By contrast, after surgically interrupting the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brain through the dorsal column of the spinal cord, wild-type mice showed normal walking behaviour, yet lost the ability to respond to external perturbations. Our findings provide direct evidence of a pivotal role for ascending proprioceptive information in achieving robust, safe locomotion. Key points Whether brain integration of proprioceptive feedback is crucial for coping with perturbed locomotion is not clear. We showed a crucial role of the brain for responding to external perturbations and ensure robust locomotion. We used mouse genetics to remove proprioceptors and a spinal lesion model to interrupt the flow of proprioceptive information to the brain through the dorsal column in wild-type animals. Using a custom-built treadmill, we administered sudden and random mechanical perturbations to mice during walking. External perturbations affected locomotion in wild-type mice similar to the absence of proprioceptors in genetically modified mice. Proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs contributed to locomotor robustness. Wild-type mice lost the ability to respond to external perturbations after interruption of the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brainstem.},

@article{Patel2009,
	abstract = {The aim was to determine the contributions of foot mechanoreceptive sensation, vision and their interaction on postural stability during quiet stance, balance perturbations and adaptive adjustments. Postural stability was measured as anteroposterior torque variance in Young (n = 25, average age = 25.1 years) and Elderly subjects (n = 16, average age = 71.5 years) during repeated calf vibrations while standing with eyes open and closed. Sensation, recorded using vibration perception and tactile sensitivity, was poorer in elderly than young subjects. Sensation was of low importance for stability during quiet stance and the first 50 s of repeated vibrations, but was associated with stability during the last three 50 s periods of balance perturbations, suggesting that the mechanoreceptive sensation affected how well postural control could adapt to repeated balance perturbations. The findings suggest that clinicians should investigate whether patients with balance problems and poor adaptation have mechanoreceptive sensation deficits.},

@article{Hurley1998,
	abstract = {Background: muscle functions to generate force-producing movement and also has a role in proprioception. If ageing compromises these sensorimotor functions of muscle, the ability of older subjects to detect and correct postural sway may be impeded, resulting in impairment of functional performance.Method: to see if age-related changes occurred and, if so, what their effects might be. Quadriceps strength, proprioception, postural stability and functional performance were assessed in young (n = 20, mean age 23 years), middle-aged (n = 10, mean age 56 years) and elderly (n = 15, mean age 72 years) subjects.Results: with increasing age there were decreases in quadriceps strength (r = -0.511; P \&lt; 0.001), acuity of joint position sense (r = -0.603; P \&lt; 0.001) and postural stability (ANOVA \&lt; 0.002) during stance conditions which placed a greater reliance on muscle proprioceptors. These changes may decrease postural stability confidence, resulting in impaired performance of common activities of daily living (r = 0.635; P \&lt; 0.001).Conclusions: the age-related deterioration in sensorimotor function of muscle may contribute to the increased fear and frequency of falls in elderly subjects, thereby decreasing independence.},

@article{Lord1996,
	abstract = {Tests of vision, vestibular function, peripheral sensation, strength, reaction time, balance and gait were administered to 183 community-dwelling women aged 22{\textendash}99 years. Walking speed, stride length and cadence declined with age with corresponding increases in stance duration and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, tactile and vibration sense in the lower limb, vestibular function (as assessed by the vestibular X Writing Test), quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength and reaction time were significantly associated with all five gait parameters. Postural sway measures were associated with walking speed, stride length and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Multiple regression analyses revealed seven sensori-motor measures as significant predictors for one or more of the gait parameters: low contrast visual acuity, tactile sensitivity, vibration sense, vestibular X-test writing performance, quadriceps strength, reaction time and sway. Quadriceps strength was included as a predictor variable for every gait parameter and in each case had the strongest beta weight. Women who fell on two or more occasions in a one-year prospective period had significantly reduced and more variable cadence and significantly increased stance duration (measured in absolute terms and as a percentage of stride) than those who did not fall or fell on one occasion only. The study findings elucidate the relative importance of specific physiological systems in the maintenance of normal gait and identify temporal gait measures that are associated with falling in older people.},
