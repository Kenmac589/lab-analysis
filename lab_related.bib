	abstract = {Joint-position sense of the knee was measured in 29 subjects with normal knee joints ranging in age from 20 to 82 years. Joint-position sense was determined by two common techniques that measure the threshold to detection of motion and the ability to reproduce passive knee positioning. Joint-position sense was found to deteriorate with increasing age as measured by both tests, with a correlation coefficient that was significant at the p less than 0.001 level for each test. The two tests were found to correlate at the p less than 0.025 level, indicating that the same biologic parameter was being measured by both tests. Deterioration of proprioception, or joint-position sense, as measured may be a sensitive indicator of subclinical degenerative joint disease of the knee, as well as a means of quantitating proprioception in suspected neuropathic joints.},

@article{Mayer2021,
	abstract = {Safe and efficient locomotion relies on placing the foot on a reliable surface at the end of each leg swing movement. Visual information has been shown to be important for determining the location of foot placement in humans during walking when precision is required. Yet in quadrupedal animals where the hindlimbs are outside of the visual field, such as in mice, the mechanisms by which precise foot placement is achieved remain unclear. Here we show that the placement of the hindlimb paw is determined by the position of the forelimb paw during normal locomotion and in the presence of perturbations. When a perturbation elicits a stumbling corrective reaction, we found that the forelimb paw shifts posteriorly relative to body at the end of stance, and this spatial shift is echoed in hindlimb paw placement at the end of the swing movement. Using a mutant mouse line in which muscle spindle feedback is selectively removed, we show that this posterior shift of paw placement is dependent on muscle spindle feedback in the hindlimb but not in the forelimb. These findings uncover a neuronal mechanism that is independent of vision to ensure safe locomotion during perturbation. This mechanism adds to our general knowledge of how the nervous system controls targeted limb movements and could inform the development of autonomous walking machines.},

	abstract = {Old adults show a decreased recovery performance compared to young ones after unexpected perturbations increasing the risk of falls. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of a specific training of mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability on the recovery performance of old adults after simulated forward falls and the contribution of muscle strength exercise. 38 old adults (two experimental groups each n=13 and a control group, n=12) participated in the study. Group 1 exercised the mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability like increase in base of support and counter-rotating segments around the centre of mass by practicing specific tasks including these mechanisms. Group 2 exercised these mechanisms of dynamic stability and muscle strength. The exercise volume was equal in both interventions (14 weeks, two times per week and \~{}1.5h per session). Stability performance has been examined by simulated forward falls before and after the intervention. The two experimental groups improved in a similar extent (\~{}35\%) their ability to regain balance during forward falls after the intervention. The reason was a faster increase in base of support. Further, the performance enhancement was related to an increase in the rate of hip moment generation. Exercising the mechanisms responsible for dynamic stability control in old adults affects their ability to regain balance after forward falls. A faster utilization of these mechanisms due to improved neuromuscular coordination resulted in the significant performance enhancement.},

@article{Bierbaum2010,
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the age-related predictive and feedback adaptive locomotor improvements in the components of dynamic stability control during disturbed walking. Thirteen old (62{\textendash}74yrs) and ten young (23{\textendash}30yrs) male subjects performed a gait protocol on a gangway, which included one covered element. By exchanging this element, the subjects walked either solely over hard surface or experienced a perturbation of the gait on the soft surface element. The gait protocol consisted of a baseline on hard surface and an adaptation phase with 19 trials on soft or hard (2nd, 8th and 19th) surface. The investigation of dynamic stability was made by using the margin of stability (MS), which was calculated as the difference between the base of support and the extrapolated center of mass (CM). Horizontal velocity of CM and its vertical projection in anterior{\textendash}posterior direction as well as the eigenfrequency of an inverted pendulum generate the extrapolated CM. As a result of the first unexpected disturbance, MS was decreased in the step following the perturbation compared to baselines in both age-groups. This decrease was higher for the old participants compared to the young ones, indicating a more unstable position in the step after the perturbation for the elderly. In the following adaptation phase, MS returned to baseline values in both age-groups. In the hard trial after the first unexpected perturbation, both age-groups increased MS at touchdown of the disturbed leg compared to baseline, reflecting fast predictive adjustments. Our findings show that the well-known age-related biological impairments did not inhibit the adaptive improvements in the components of dynamic stability in the elderly. However, the feedback corrections after the first unexpected perturbation were less effective for the elderly. This may increase the risk of falling.},

@article{Bierbaum2011,
	abstract = {After perturbation of the gait, feedback information may help regaining balance adequately, but it remains unknown whether adaptive feedback responses are possible after repetitive and unexpected perturbations during gait and if there are age-related differences. Prior experience may contribute to improved reactive behavior. Fourteen old (59{\textendash}73yrs) and fourteen young (22{\textendash}31yrs) males walked on a walkway which included one covered element. By exchanging this element participants either stepped on hard surface or unexpectedly on soft surface which caused a perturbation in gait. The gait protocol contained 5 unexpected soft trials to quantify the reactive adaptation. Each soft trial was followed by 4{\textendash}8 hard trials to generate a wash-out effect. The dynamic stability was investigated by using the margin of stability (MoS), which was calculated as the difference between the anterior boundary of the base of support and the extrapolated position of the center of mass in the anterior-posterior direction. MoS at recovery leg touchdown were significantly lower in the unexpected soft trials compared to the baseline, indicating a less stable posture. However, MoS increased (p{\textless}0.05) in both groups within the disturbed trials, indicating feedback adaptive improvements. Young and old participants showed differences in the handling of the perturbation in the course of several trials. The magnitude of the reactive adaptation after the fifth unexpected perturbation was significantly different compared to the first unexpected perturbation (old: 49{\textpm}30\%; young: 77{\textpm}40\%), showing a tendency (p=0.065) for higher values in the young participants. Old individuals maintain the ability to adapt to feedback controlled perturbations. However, the locomotor behavior is more conservative compared to the young ones, leading to disadvantages in the reactive adaptation during disturbed walking.},

@article{Bizzi1991,
	abstract = {To execute voluntary movements, the central nervous system must transform the neural representation of the direction, amplitude, and velocity of the limb, represented by the activity of cortical and subcortical neurons, into signals that activate the muscles that move the limb. This task is equivalent to solving an "ill-posed" computational problem because the number of degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus is much larger than that specified in the plan of action. Some of the mechanisms and circuitry underlying the transformation of motor plans into motor commands are described. A central feature of this transformation is a coarse map of limb postures in the premotor areas of the spinal cord. Vectorial combination of motor outputs among different areas of the spinal map may produce a large repertoire of motor behaviors.},

@article{Cappellini2006,
	abstract = {Despite distinct differences between walking and running, the two types of human locomotion are likely to be controlled by shared pattern-generating networks. However, the differences between their kinematics and kinetics imply that corresponding muscle activations may also be quite different. We examined the differences between walking and running by recording kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity in 32 ipsilateral limb and trunk muscles during human locomotion, and compared the effects of speed (3{\textendash}12 km/h) and gait. We found that the timing of muscle activation was accounted for by five basic temporal activation components during running as we previously found for walking. Each component was loaded on similar sets of leg muscles in both gaits but generally on different sets of upper trunk and shoulder muscles. The major difference between walking and running was that one temporal component, occurring during stance, was shifted to an earlier phase in the step cycle during running. These muscle activation differences between gaits did not simply depend on locomotion speed as shown by recordings during each gait over the same range of speeds (5{\textendash}9 km/h). The results are consistent with an organization of locomotion motor programs having two parts, one that organizes muscle activation during swing and another during stance and the transition to swing. The timing shift between walking and running reflects therefore the difference in the relative duration of the stance phase in the two gaits.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that clozapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics), tamoxifen (selective-estrogen receptor modulator) and pioglitazone (PPAR$\gamma$ agonist) may improve functional recovery in multiple sclerosis (MS). We have compared the effectiveness of oral administration of these drugs, beginning at peak disease, at reducing ascending paralysis, motor deficits and demyelination in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Mice were immunized with an immunogenic peptide corresponding to amino acids 35{\textendash}55 of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35{\textendash}55) in complete Freund's adjuvant and injected with pertussis toxin to induce EAE. Unlike clozapine, quetiapine and tamoxifen, administration of pioglitazone beginning at peak disease decreased both clinical scores and lumbar white matter loss in EAE mice. Using kinematic gait analysis, we found that pioglitazone also maintained normal movement of the hip, knee and ankle joints for at least 44 days after MOG35{\textendash}55 immunization. This long-lasting preservation of hindleg joint movements was accompanied by reduced white matter loss, microglial and macrophage activation and the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the lumbar spinal cords of EAE mice. These results support clinical findings that suggest pioglitazone may reduce the progressive loss of motor function in MS by decreasing inflammation and myelin damage.},

To address whether spindles, in turn, regulate the function of Ia afferents, we examined Egr3-null mutant mice (Egr3-/-), in which muscle spindles degenerate progressively after birth. Egr3-/- mice develop gait ataxia, scoliosis, resting tremors, and ptosis, suggesting a defect in proprioception. Despite the normal morphological appearance of peripheral and central sensory projections, we observed a profound functional deficit in the strength of sensory{\textendash}motor connections in Egr3-/- mice. Muscle spindles in Egr3-/- mice do not express NT3. Intramuscular injections of NT3 to Egr3-/- mice during the postnatal period restored sensory{\textendash}motor connections. Thus, NT3 derived from muscle spindles regulates the synaptic connectivity between muscle sensory and motor neurons.},

Here, we assess to what extent the motor system relies on centrally organized synergies activated by spinal and/or supraspinal commands to generate motor outputs by analyzing electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from 13 hindlimb muscles of the bullfrog during swimming and jumping, before and after deafferentation. We first established that, for both behaviors, the intact and deafferented data sets possess low and similar dimensionalities. Subsequently, we used a novel reformulation of the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm to simultaneously search for synergies shared by, and synergies specific to, the intact and deafferented data sets. Most muscle synergies were identified as shared synergies, suggesting that EMGs of locomotor behaviors are generated primarily by centrally organized synergies. Both the amplitude and temporal patterns of the activation coefficients of most shared synergies, however, were altered by deafferentation, suggesting that sensory inflow modulates activation of those centrally organized synergies. For most synergies, effects of deafferentation on the activation coefficients were not consistent across frogs, indicating substantial interanimal variability of feedback actions. We speculate that sensory feedback might adapt recruitment of muscle synergies to behavioral constraints, and the few synergies specific to the intact or deafferented states might represent afferent-specific modules or feedback reorganization of spinal neuronal networks.},

	abstract = {Kinematic gait analysis in the sagittal plane has frequently been used to characterize motor deficits in multiple sclerosis (MS). We describe the application of these techniques to identify gait deficits in a mouse model of MS, known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Paralysis and motor deficits in mice subjected to EAE are typically assessed using a clinical scoring scale. However, this scale yields only ordinal data that provides little information about the precise nature of the motor deficits. EAE disease severity has also been assessed by rotarod performance, which provides a measure of general motor coordination. By contrast, kinematic gait analysis of the hind limb in the sagittal plane generates highly precise information about how movement is impaired. To perform this procedure, reflective markers are placed on a hind limb to detect joint movement while a mouse is walking on a treadmill. Motion analysis software is used to measure movement of the markers during walking. Kinematic gait parameters are then derived from the resultant data. We show how these gait parameters can be used to quantify impaired movements of the hip, knee, and ankle joints in EAE. These techniques may be used to better understand disease mechanisms and identify potential treatments for MS and other neurodegenerative disorders that impair mobility.},

@article{Fiander2017,
	abstract = {The preclinical selection of therapeutic candidates for progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) would be aided by the development of sensitive behavioural measures that accurately reflect the impact of autoimmune-mediated spinal cord damage on locomotion. Neurological deficits in mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are typically scored using a clinical scale with 5{\textendash}10 levels of increased disease severity. This ordinal scale represents a general impression of paralysis and impaired gait. By contrast, kinematic gait analyses generate ratio level data that have frequently been used to characterize walking deficits for MS patients and test the efficacy of treatments designed to improve them. Despite these advantages, kinematic gait analyses have not been systematically applied to the study of walking deficits for EAE mice. We have therefore used high speed video recordings (250 frames/s) of EAE mice walking on a treadmill to measure 8 kinematic parameters in the sagittal plane: average hip height (1), average toe height during swing (2), and average angle and range of motion for the hip (3{\textendash}4), knee (5{\textendash}6) and ankle (7{\textendash}8). Kinematic measures of hip, knee and ankle movements were found to be early detectors of impaired locomotion for mice with mild EAE (median clinical score=1.0 at day post-immunization 26; DPI 26). These deficits occurred in the absence of reduced rotarod performance with impaired hip and knee movements observed 3days before disease onset as determined by clinical scores. Gait deficits for mild EAE mice were minor and often recovered fully by DPI 30. By contrast, severe EAE mice (median clinical score=2.5 at DPI 26) displayed much larger movement impairments for the knee and ankle that failed to completely recover by DPI 44. Moreover, impaired ankle movement was highly correlated with white matter loss in the spinal cords of EAE mice (r=0.96). Kinematic analyses therefore yield highly sensitive measures of motor deficits that predict spinal cord injury in EAE mice. These behavioural techniques should assist the selection of promising therapeutic candidates for clinical testing in progressive MS.},

@article{Guertin2013,
	abstract = {This article provides a perspective on major innovations over the past century in research on the spinal cord and, specifically, on specialized spinal circuits involved in the control of rhythmic locomotor pattern generation and modulation. Pioneers such as Charles Sherrington and Thomas Graham Brown have conducted experiments in the early twentieth century that changed our views of the neural control of locomotion. Their seminal work supported subsequently by several decades of evidence has led to the conclusion that walking, flying, and swimming are largely controlled by a network of spinal neurons generally referred to as the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. It has been subsequently demonstrated across all vertebrate species examined, from lampreys to humans, that this CPG is capable, under some conditions, to self-produce, even in absence of descending or peripheral inputs, basic rhythmic, and coordinated locomotor movements. Recent evidence suggests, in turn, that plasticity changes of some CPG elements may contribute to the development of specific pathophysiological conditions associated with impaired locomotion or spontaneous locomotor-like movements. This article constitutes a comprehensive review summarizing key findings on the CPG as well as on its potential role in Restless Leg Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movement, and Alternating Leg Muscle Activation. Special attention will be paid to the role of the CPG in a recently identified, and uniquely different neurological disorder, called the Uner Tan Syndrome.},

@article{Hamed2018,
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a specific exercise intervention of mechanisms to control dynamic postural stability under unstable conditions in old adults. Forty-seven old adults (65-80 years) were assigned to 2 experimental groups (muscle strength group, n = 15; perturbation-based group, n = 16) and a control group (n = 16). The strength group performed resistance exercises for leg and trunk muscles, while the perturbation-based group exercised mechanisms of dynamic stability under unstable conditions. The training duration was 14 weeks, with training sessions twice a week for 1.5 hours. Muscle strength, balance ability, and balance recovery performance were investigated before and after the interventions using maximal isometric plantar flexion and knee extension contractions, the approach of the center of pressure to the anterior limits of stability and simulated forward falls. Both interventions increased balance recovery performance in simulated forward falls (81\%, d = 1.50 and 80\%, d = 1.08 in the muscle strength and perturbation-based group, respectively), while the control group did not show any changes. Plantar flexor strength increased 20\% (d = 0.72) in the muscle strength and 23\% (d = 1.03) in the perturbation-based group, while muscle strength of the knee extensors increased only in the muscle strength group (8\%, d = 0.76). On the other hand, only the perturbation-based group showed a significant improvement of standing balance ability (38\%, d = 1.61). We conclude that a perturbation-based training program focusing on exercising mechanisms of dynamic stability in unstable conditions has the potential to enhance muscle strength as well as sensory information processing within the motor system during sudden and static balance tasks and, as a consequence, reduce the risk of falls in old adults.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to review the evidence of the economic burden of falls in old age. This review showed that falls are a relevant economic burden. Efforts should be directed to fall-prevention programs. Falls are a common mechanism of injury and a leading cause of costs of injury in the elderly. The purpose of this study was to review for the first time the evidence of the economic burden caused by falls in old age. A systematic review was conducted in the databases of PubMed, of the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews until June 2009. Studies were assessed for inclusion, classified and synthesized. Costs per inhabitant, the share of fall-related costs in total health care expenditures and in gross domestic products (GDP) were calculated. If appropriate, cost data were inflated to the year 2006 and converted to US Dollar (USD PPP). A total of 32 studies were included. National fall-related costs of prevalence-based studies were between 0.85\% and 1.5\% of the total health care expenditures, 0.07\% to 0.20\% of the GDP and ranged from 113 to 547 USD PPP per inhabitant. Direct costs occurred especially in higher age groups, in females, in hospitals and long-term care facilities and for fractures. Mean costs per fall victim, per fall and per fall-related hospitalization ranged from 2,044 to 25,955; 1,059 to 10,913 and 5,654 to 42,840 USD PPP and depended on fall severity. A more detailed comparison is restricted by the limited number of studies. Falls are a relevant economic burden to society. Efforts should be directed to economic evaluations of fall-prevention programs aiming at reducing fall-related fractures, which contribute substantially to fall-related costs.

	abstract = {Sensory information arising from limb movements controls the spinal locomotor circuitry to adapt the motor pattern to demands of the environment. Stimulation of extensor group (gr) I afferents during fictive locomotion in decerebrate cats prolongs the ongoing extension, and terminates ongoing flexion with an initiation of the subsequent extension, i. e. {\textquotedblleft}resetting to extension{\textquotedblright}. Moreover, instead of the classical Ib non-reciprocal inhibition, stimulation of extensor gr I afferents produces a polysynaptic excitation in extensor motoneurons with latencies (\~{}3.5{\textendash}4.0 ms) compatible with 3 interposed interneurons. We assume that some interneurons in this pathway actually belong to the rhythm-generating layer of the locomotor Central Pattern Generator (CPG), since their activity was correlated to a resetting of the rhythm. In the present work fictive locomotion was (mostly) induced by i.v. injection of nialamide followed by l-DOPA in paralyzed cats following decerebration and spinalization at C1 level. In some experiments, we extended previous observations during fictive locomotion on the emergence and locomotor state-dependence of polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials from extensor gr I afferents to ankle extensor motoneurons. However, the main focus was to record location and properties of interneurons (n = 62) that (i) were active during the extensor phase of fictive locomotion and (ii) received short-latency excitation (mono-, di- or polysynaptic) from extensor gr I afferents. We conclude that the interneurons recorded fulfill the characteristics to belong to the neuronal pathway activated by extensor gr I afferents during locomotion, and may contribute to the {\textquoteleft}resetting to extension{\textquoteright} as part of the locomotor CPG.
Traditionally, research aimed at the understanding of the sensory control of terrestrial mammalian locomotion has focused on cats as the animal model. But advances in molecular genetics and new methods to record movement in small animals have moved mice into the forefront of locomotor research. In this review article, I will first give an overview of what is known about sensory feedback control of locomotion, mainly emerged from experiments performed on cats. This overview will not be an exhaustive overview, but will rather aim to give a broad picture of what has been learned about the sensory control of locomotion using cats as the animal model. I will then give a brief summary of how the mouse is adding to these insights.
This chapter reviews different methods for the control of legged locomotion with a special focus on bipedal locomotion. All locomotion systems are governed by complex nonlinear, hybrid dynamics, and are redundant, underactuated and often unstable, which makes their control a very challenging task.
The chapter starts with a presentation of different concepts of stability and robustness of locomotion considering nominal walking situations as well as the reaction to larger external perturbations. Then, optimal control is discussed as a guiding principle of human and robot motion, and dynamic multibody system models as well as different optimization problem formulations for the generation, control and analysis of locomotion are shown. Constant or variable compliance plays an important role in biological and bio-inspired locomotion, but needs to be properly adapted in the design and control process which also can be addressed by optimal control.

This chapter reviews different methods for the control of legged locomotion with a special focus on bipedal locomotion. All locomotion systems are governed by complex nonlinear, hybrid dynamics, and are redundant, underactuated and often unstable, which makes their control a very challenging task.
The chapter starts with a presentation of different concepts of stability and robustness of locomotion considering nominal walking situations as well as the reaction to larger external perturbations. Then, optimal control is discussed as a guiding principle of human and robot motion, and dynamic multibody system models as well as different optimization problem formulations for the generation, control and analysis of locomotion are shown. Constant or variable compliance plays an important role in biological and bio-inspired locomotion, but needs to be properly adapted in the design and control process which also can be addressed by optimal control.

Genetic techniques rendering murine models a popular choice for neuroscience research has led to important insights on neural networks controlling locomotor function. Using genetically altered mouse models for in vivo, electrophysiological studies in the adult state could validate key principles of locomotor network organization that have been described in neonatal, in vitro preparations.
The experimental model presented here describes a decerebrate, in vivo adult mouse preparation in which focal, electrical midbrain stimulation was combined with monitoring lumbar neural activity and motor output after pre-collicular decerebration and neuromuscular blockade.
Lumbar cord dorsum potentials (in 9/10 animals) and motoneuron output (in 3/5 animals) including fictive locomotion, was achieved by focal midbrain stimulation. The stimulation electrode locations could be reconstructed (in 6/7 animals) thereby allowing anatomical identification of the stimulated supraspinal regions.
This preparation allows for concomitant recording or stimulation in the spinal cord and in the mid/hindbrain of adult mice. It differs from other methods used in the past with adult mice as it does not require pharmacological manipulation of neural excitability in order to generate motor output.
Midbrain stimulation can consistently be used for inducing lumbar neural activity in adult mice under neuromuscular blockade. This model is suited for examination of brain-spinal connectivity and it may benefit a wide range of fields depending on the features of the genetically modified mouse models used in combination with the presented methods.
Roy RR, Harkema SJ, Edgerton VR. Basic concepts of activity-based interventions for improved recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury.
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that affects a large number of individuals. Historically, the recovery process after an SCI has been slow and with limited success. Recently, a number of advances have been made in the strategies used for rehabilitation, resulting in marked improved recovery, even after a complete SCI. Several rehabilitative interventions, that is, assisted motor training, spinal cord epidural stimulation, and/or administration of pharmacologic agents, alone or in combination, have produced remarkable recovery in motor function in both humans and animals. The success with each of these interventions appears to be related to the fact that the spinal cord is smart, in that it can use ensembles of sensory information to generate appropriate motor responses without input from supraspinal centers, a property commonly referred to as central pattern generation. This ability of the spinal cord reflects a level of automaticity, that is, the ability of the neural circuitry of the spinal cord to interpret complex sensory information and to make appropriate decisions to generate successful postural and locomotor tasks. Herein, we provide a brief review of some of the neurophysiologic rationale for the success of these interventions.},

	abstract = {On a global basis, adults 65 years of age and older experience falls more frequently than younger individuals, and these often result in severe injuries as well as increased healthcare costs. Gait and balance disorders in this population are among the most common causes of falls and negatively influence quality of life and survivorship. Although falls are a major public health problem and guidelines/recommendations are available to physicians, many are fully aware of different assessments, tools, and resources available for intervention. Given the risk for potentially devastating outcomes if severe injuries occur secondary to a fall, fall prevention strategies in clinical offices is a timely consideration in today{\textquoteright}s health care landscape. This paper presents a three-tier model, comprising assessment, prevention, and intervention, to highlight methods, proactive programs, and innovative tools and technology that have been developed for fall prevention. Awareness of these resources will enhance the clinician{\textquoteright}s ability to accurately assess balance and gait, which can improve physical function, and decrease the risk of falls for both average-risk and high-risk older adults.},

	abstract = {Sensory information from one leg has been known to elicit reflex responses in the contralateral leg, known as {\textquotedblleft}crossed reflexes,{\textquotedblright} and these have been investigated extensively in cats and humans. Furthermore, experiments with mice have shown commissural pathways in detail by using in vitro and in vivo physiological approaches combined with genetics. However, the relationship between these commissural pathways discovered in mice and crossed reflex pathways described in cats and humans is not known. In this study, we analyzed the crossed reflex in mice by using in vivo electromyographic recording techniques combined with peripheral nerve stimulation protocols to provide a detailed description of the crossed reflex pathways. We show that excitatory crossed reflexes are mediated by both proprioceptive and cutaneous afferent activation. In addition, we provide evidence for a short-latency inhibitory crossed reflex pathway likely mediated by cutaneous feedback. Furthermore, the short-latency crossed inhibition is downregulated in the knee extensor muscle and the ankle flexor muscle during locomotion. In conclusion, this article provides an analysis of excitatory and inhibitory crossed reflex pathways during resting and locomoting mice in vivo. The data presented in this article pave the way for future research aimed at understanding crossed reflexes using genetics in mice.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY We describe for the first time excitatory and inhibitory crossed reflex pathways in mouse spinal cord in vivo and show that the inhibitory pathways are modulated during walking. This is a first step toward an understanding of crossed reflexes and their function during walking using in vivo recording techniques combined with mouse genetics.},

@article{Lam2001,
	abstract = {This study examined the influence of proprioceptive input from hip flexor muscles on the activity in hip flexors during the swing phase of walking in the decerebrate cat. One hindlimb was partially denervated to remove cutaneous input and afferent input from most other hindlimb muscles. Perturbations to hip movement were applied either by 1) manual resistance or assistance to swing or by 2) resistance to hip flexion using a device that blocked hip flexion but allowed leg extension. Electromyographic recordings were made from the iliopsoas (IP), sartorius, and medial gastrocnemius muscles. When the hip was manually assisted into flexion, there was a reduction in hip flexor burst activity. Conversely, when hip flexion was manually resisted or mechanically blocked during swing, the duration and amplitude of hip flexor activity was increased. We also found some specificity in the role of afferents from individual hip flexor muscles in the modulation of flexor burst activity. If the IP muscle was detached from its insertion, little change in the response to blocking flexion was observed. Specific activation of IP afferent fibers by stretching the muscle also did not greatly affect flexor activity. On the other hand, if conduction in the sartorius nerves was blocked, there was a diminished response to blocking hip flexion. The increase in duration of the flexor bursts still occurred, but this increase was consistently lower than that observed when the sartorius nerves were intact. From these results we propose that during swing, feedback from hip flexor muscle afferents, particularly those from the sartorius muscles, enhances flexor activity. In addition, if we delayed the onset of flexor activity in the contralateral hindlimb, blocking hip flexion often resulted in the prolongation of ipsilateral flexor activity for long periods of time, further revealing the reinforcing effects of flexor afferent feedback on flexor activity. This effect was not seen if conduction in the sartorius nerves was blocked. In conclusion, we have found that hip flexor activity during locomotion can be strongly modulated by modifying proprioceptive feedback from the hip flexor muscles.},

	abstract = {Motor adaptation requires efficient integration of sensory information with predicted sensory consequences of one{\textquoteright}s own action. However, the effect of reduced sensory acuity on motor adaptation in humans remains to be further investigated. Here, we examined the variability of proprioceptive acuity during an arm-position matching task and the pattern of visuomotor adaptation in older and young adults, and determined the relationship between the two variables. The older adults, a known example of impaired proprioceptive acuity, exhibited greater trial-to-trial variability during the arm-position matching task as compared with the young adults. Furthermore, the older adults showed a slower rate of adaptation to a 30{\textdegree} visuomotor rotation during targeted reaching movements, as well as larger movement errors in the later phase of adaptation, than the young adults. Our correlation analyses indicated a negative association between the variability in proprioceptive acuity and the rate of visuomotor adaptation in the older adults; and no association was observed in the young adults. These findings point to a possibility that an increase in the variability of proprioceptive acuity due to aging may weaken the integration of predicted and actual sensory feedback, which in turn may result in poor visuomotor adaptation in older adults.},

	abstract = {Tests of vision, vestibular function, peripheral sensation, strength, reaction time, balance and gait were administered to 183 community-dwelling women aged 22{\textendash}99 years. Walking speed, stride length and cadence declined with age with corresponding increases in stance duration and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, tactile and vibration sense in the lower limb, vestibular function (as assessed by the vestibular X Writing Test), quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength and reaction time were significantly associated with all five gait parameters. Postural sway measures were associated with walking speed, stride length and percentage of the stride in the stance phase. Multiple regression analyses revealed seven sensori-motor measures as significant predictors for one or more of the gait parameters: low contrast visual acuity, tactile sensitivity, vibration sense, vestibular X-test writing performance, quadriceps strength, reaction time and sway. Quadriceps strength was included as a predictor variable for every gait parameter and in each case had the strongest beta weight. Women who fell on two or more occasions in a one-year prospective period had significantly reduced and more variable cadence and significantly increased stance duration (measured in absolute terms and as a percentage of stride) than those who did not fall or fell on one occasion only. The study findings elucidate the relative importance of specific physiological systems in the maintenance of normal gait and identify temporal gait measures that are associated with falling in older people.},

@article{Mayer2018,
	abstract = {The ability to walk around in a natural environment requires the capacity to cope with unexpected obstacles that may disrupt locomotion. One such mechanism is called the stumbling corrective reaction (SCR) that enables animals to step over obstacles that would otherwise disturb the progression of swing movement. Here we use in vivo motion analysis and physiological recording techniques to describe the SCR in mice. We show that SCR can be elicited consistently in mice during locomotion by inserting an obstacle along the path of leg movement during swing phase. Furthermore, we show that the same behavior can be elicited if the saphenous nerve, a cutaneous nerve that would detect contact of the leg with an object, is stimulated electrically. This suggests that cutaneous afferent feedback is sufficient to elicit SCR. We further show that the SCR is phase dependent, occurring only with stimulation during swing phase, but not during early stance. During SCR elicited by either method, the foot is lifted higher to clear the object by flexing the knee, via the semitendinosus muscle, and ankle joint, by tibialis anterior contraction. The tibialis anterior also exhibits a brief extension before flexion onset. Our data provide a detailed description of SCR in mice and will be crucial for future research that aims to identify the interneurons of the premotor network controlling SCR and its neuronal mechanisms by combining motion analysis, electrophysiology and mouse genetics.},

@article{Mayer2018a,
	abstract = {Terrestrial animals increase their walking speed by increasing the activity of the extensor muscles. However, the mechanism underlying how this speed-dependent amplitude modulation is achieved remains obscure. Previous studies have shown that group Ib afferent feedback from Golgi tendon organs that signal force is one of the major regulators of the strength of muscle activity during walking in cats and humans. In contrast, the contribution of group Ia/II afferent feedback from muscle spindle stretch receptors that signal angular displacement of leg joints is unclear. Some studies indicate that group II afferent feedback may be important for amplitude regulation in humans, but the role of muscle spindle feedback in regulation of muscle activity strength in quadrupedal animals is very poorly understood. To examine the role of feedback from muscle spindles, we combined in vivo electrophysiology and motion analysis with mouse genetics and gene delivery with adeno-associated virus. We provide evidence that proprioceptive sensory feedback from muscle spindles is important for the regulation of the muscle activity strength and speed-dependent amplitude modulation. Furthermore, our data suggest that feedback from the muscle spindles of the ankle extensor muscles, the triceps surae, is the main source for this mechanism. In contrast, muscle spindle feedback from the knee extensor muscles, the quadriceps femoris, has no influence on speed-dependent amplitude modulation. We provide evidence that proprioceptive feedback from ankle extensor muscles is critical for regulating muscle activity strength as gait speed increases.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Animals upregulate the activity of extensor muscles to increase their walking speed, but the mechanism behind this is not known. We show that this speed-dependent amplitude modulation requires proprioceptive sensory feedback from muscle spindles of ankle extensor muscle. In the absence of muscle spindle feedback, animals cannot walk at higher speeds as they can when muscle spindle feedback is present.},

@article{McVea2005,
	abstract = {In this investigation, we obtained data that support the hypothesis that afferent signals associated with hip flexion play a role in initiating the swing-to-stance transition of the hind legs in walking cats. Direct evidence came from observations in walking decerebrate cats. Assisting the flexion of the hip joint during swing advanced the onset of activity in ankle extensor muscles, and this advance was strongly correlated with a reduction in the duration of hip flexor muscle activity. The hip angle at the time of onset of the flexion to extension transition was similar during assisted and unassisted steps. Additional evidence for the hypothesis that sensory signals related to hip flexion are important in regulating the swing-to-stance transition came from four normal animals trained to walk in a variety of situations designed to alter the coordination of movements at the hip, knee, and ankle joints during the swing phase. Although there were exceptions in some tasks and preparations, the angle of the hip joint at the time of onset of extensor activity was generally less variable than that of the knee and ankle joints. We also found no clear relationships between the angle of the limb and body axes, or the length of the limb axis, and the time of onset of extensor activity. Finally, there were no indications that the stretching of ankle extensor muscles during swing was a factor in regulating the transition from swing-to-stance.},

	abstract = {The aim was to determine the contributions of foot mechanoreceptive sensation, vision and their interaction on postural stability during quiet stance, balance perturbations and adaptive adjustments. Postural stability was measured as anteroposterior torque variance in Young (n = 25, average age = 25.1 years) and Elderly subjects (n = 16, average age = 71.5 years) during repeated calf vibrations while standing with eyes open and closed. Sensation, recorded using vibration perception and tactile sensitivity, was poorer in elderly than young subjects. Sensation was of low importance for stability during quiet stance and the first 50 s of repeated vibrations, but was associated with stability during the last three 50 s periods of balance perturbations, suggesting that the mechanoreceptive sensation affected how well postural control could adapt to repeated balance perturbations. The findings suggest that clinicians should investigate whether patients with balance problems and poor adaptation have mechanoreceptive sensation deficits.},

Here, we describe a new method for the fabrication and implantation of fine EMG recording electrodes into multiple muscles of adult mice. This method minimizes surgical damage to the muscles and the connecting leads have only a modest influence on leg movements when electrodes are implanted into distal muscles. We demonstrate that excellent EMG recordings can be obtained during walking, swimming and scratching for the vastus lateralis, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles in normal adult mice. EMG recordings were also made in a mutant EphA4 mouse to demonstrate the utility of the method for examining motor patterns in genetically modified animals. We also developed a method for constructing highly reflective markers that could be viewed over a range of orientations to measure the kinematics of legs movements during stepping. A commercial motion analysis system was used to track six markers during walking and to synchronize video and EMG data during walking sequences.},

	abstract = {Locomotion results from intricate dynamic interactions between a central program and feedback mechanisms. The central program relies fundamentally on a genetically determined spinal circuitry (central pattern generator) capable of generating the basic locomotor pattern and on various descending pathways that can trigger, stop, and steer locomotion. The feedback originates from muscles and skin afferents as well as from special senses (vision, audition, vestibular) and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern to the requirements of the environment. The dynamic interactions are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust the timing and amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the opposite phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. Similarly, stimulation of descending pathways may affect the locomotor pattern in only certain phases of the step cycle. Section ii reviews dynamic sensorimotor interactions mainly through spinal pathways. Section iii describes how similar sensory inputs from the spinal or supraspinal levels can modify locomotion through descending pathways. The sensorimotor interactions occur obviously at several levels of the nervous system. Section iv summarizes presynaptic, interneuronal, and motoneuronal mechanisms that are common at these various levels. Together these mechanisms contribute to the continuous dynamic adjustment of sensorimotor interactions, ensuring that the central program and feedback mechanisms are congruous during locomotion.},

	abstract = {The need to move over uneven terrain is a daily challenge. In order to face unexpected perturbations due to changes in the morphology of the terrain, the central nervous system must flexibly modify its control strategies. We analysed the local dynamic stability and the modular organisation of muscle activation (muscle synergies) during walking and running on an even- and an uneven-surface treadmill. We hypothesized a reduced stability during uneven-surface locomotion and a reorganisation of the modular control. We found a decreased stability when switching from even- to uneven-surface locomotion (p {\textless} 0.001 in walking, p = 0.001 in running). Moreover, we observed a substantial modification of the time-dependent muscle activation patterns (motor primitives) despite a general conservation of the time-independent coefficients (motor modules). The motor primitives were considerably wider in the uneven-surface condition. Specifically, the widening was significant in both the early (+40.5\%, p {\textless} 0.001) and late swing (+7.7\%, p = 0.040) phase in walking and in the weight acceptance (+13.6\%, p = 0.006) and propulsion (+6.0\%, p = 0.041) phase in running. This widening highlighted an increased motor output{\textquoteright}s robustness (i.e. ability to cope with errors) when dealing with the unexpected perturbations. Our results confirmed the hypothesis that humans adjust their motor control strategies{\textquoteright} timing to deal with unsteady locomotion.},

	abstract = {Muscle spindles are skeletal muscle sensory organs that provide axial and limb position information (proprioception) to the central nervous system. Spindles consist of encapsulated muscle fibers (intrafusal fibers) that are innervated by specialized motor and sensory axons. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in spindle ontogeny are poorly understood, the innervation of a subset of developing myotubes (type I) by peripheral sensory afferents (group Ia) is a critical event for inducing intrafusal fiber differentiation and subsequent spindle formation1,2,3. The Egr family of zinc-finger transcription factors, whose members include Egr1 (NGFI-A), Egr2 (Krox-20), Egr3 and Egr4 (NGFI-C), are thought to regulate critical genetic programs involved in cellular growth and differentiation (refs 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and W.G.T. et al., manuscript submitted). Mice deficient in Egr3 were generated by gene targeting and had gait ataxia, increased frequency of perinatal mortality, scoliosis, resting tremors and ptosis. Although extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers appeared normal, Egr3-deficient animals lacked muscle spindles, a finding that is consistent with their profound gait ataxia. Egr3 was highly expressed in developing muscle spindles, but not in Ia afferent neurons or their terminals during developmental periods that coincided with the induction of spindle morphogenesis by sensory afferent axons. These results indicate that type I myotubes are dependent upon Egr3-mediated transcription for proper spindle development.},

	abstract = {Walking is a key motor behaviour of limbed animals, executed by contraction of functionally antagonistic muscle groups during swing and stance phases. Nevertheless, neuronal circuits regulating the activation of antagonistic extensor-flexor muscles remain poorly understood. Here we use monosynaptically restricted trans-synaptic viruses to elucidate premotor anatomical substrates for extensor-flexor control in mice. We observe a medio-lateral spatial segregation between extensor and flexor premotor interneurons in the dorsal spinal cord. These premotor interneuron populations are derived from common progenitor domains, but segregate by timing of neurogenesis. We find that proprioceptive sensory feedback from the periphery is targeted to medial extensor premotor populations and is required for extensor-specific connectivity profiles during development. Our findings provide evidence for a discriminating anatomical basis of antagonistic circuits at the level of premotor interneurons, and point to synaptic input and developmental ontogeny as key factors in the establishment of circuits regulating motor behavioural dichotomy.

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal aging is a major public health interesting and strain due to the significant demographic modifications in the population, and it is linked to high risk of falls, loss of autonomy in elderly individuals and institutionalization with small health outcomes. Thus, this pathological status is related to high morbidity and health care rates. Bone mass and muscle mass and strength increase during late adolescence and early adulthood but start to reduce noticeably from the fifth decade of life and are closely linked. Bone and muscle tissues were increasingly recognized, as endocrine target organs and endocrine organs themselves, interacting through paracrine and endocrine signals. During growth, bone mineral content closely correlates with muscle mass, and several evidences suggest that osteoporosis and sarcopenia present common pathophysiological factors and show the correlation between low bone mineral density and sarcopenia in both men and women. Then, sarcopenia and osteoporosis, typical features of aging, are often associated with each other and with the frailty syndrome. In particular, sarcopenia and osteoporosis are major contributors to disability and frailty and the common denominators are age-related chronic inflammation, changes in body composition and hormonal imbalance. Frailty syndrome is characterized by a reduced response to stress, triggering the decline of the physiological functioning of the various systems. Frailty syndrome, typical of the older people, is frequently associated with a reduction in the quality of life and mobility. Falls often are the basis of reduced mobility and ability to perform the common functions of daily life and the increase in the number of institutionalizations. Moreover, the reduction of muscle mass, associated with altered muscle composition, fat and fibrous infiltration and alterations in innervations, and the increase in fat mass, have a synergistic effect on the increase in cardiovascular risk. The aim of this review is to analyze the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the frailty syndrome and its association with sarcopenia and osteoporosis, and investigate possible intervention measures.},

	abstract = {Key points Locomotion on land and in water requires the coordination of a great number of muscle activations and joint movements. Constant feedback about the position of own body parts in relation to the surrounding environment and the body itself (proprioception) is required to maintain stability and avoid failure. The central nervous system may follow a modular type of organization by controlling muscles in orchestrated groups (muscle synergies) rather than individually. We used this concept on genetically modified mice lacking muscle spindles, one of the two main classes of proprioceptors. We provide evidence that proprioceptive feedback is required by the central nervous system to accurately tune the modular organization of locomotion. Abstract For exploiting terrestrial and aquatic locomotion, vertebrates must build their locomotor patterns based on an enormous amount of variables. The great number of muscles and joints, together with the constant need for sensory feedback information (e.g. proprioception), make the task of controlling movement a problem with overabundant degrees of freedom. It is widely accepted that the central nervous system may simplify the creation and control of movement by generating activation patterns common to muscle groups, rather than specific to individual muscles. These activation patterns, called muscle synergies, describe the modular organization of movement. We extracted synergies through electromyography from the hind limb muscle activities of wild-type and genetically modified mice lacking sensory feedback from muscle spindles. Muscle spindle-deficient mice underwent a modification of the temporal structure (motor primitives) of muscle synergies that resulted in diminished functionality during walking. In addition, both the temporal and spatial (motor modules) components of synergies were severely affected when external perturbations were introduced or when animals were immersed in water. These findings show that sensory feedback from group Ia/II muscle spindles regulates motor function in normal and perturbed walking. Moreover, when group Ib Golgi tendon organ feedback is lacking due to enhanced buoyancy, the modular organization of swimming is almost completely compromised.},

	abstract = {Robust locomotion relies on information from proprioceptors: sensory organs that communicate the position of body parts to the spinal cord and brain. Proprioceptive circuits in the spinal cord are known to coarsely regulate locomotion in the presence of perturbations. Yet, the regulatory importance of the brain in maintaining robust locomotion remains less clear. Here, through mouse genetic studies and in vivo electrophysiology, we examined the role of the brain in integrating proprioceptive information during perturbed locomotion. The systemic removal of proprioceptors left the mice in a constantly perturbed state, similar to that observed during mechanically perturbed locomotion in wild-type mice and characterised by longer and less accurate synergistic activation patterns. By contrast, after surgically interrupting the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brain through the dorsal column of the spinal cord, wild-type mice showed normal walking behaviour, yet lost the ability to respond to external perturbations. Our findings provide direct evidence of a pivotal role for ascending proprioceptive information in achieving robust, safe locomotion. Key points Whether brain integration of proprioceptive feedback is crucial for coping with perturbed locomotion is not clear. We showed a crucial role of the brain for responding to external perturbations and ensure robust locomotion. We used mouse genetics to remove proprioceptors and a spinal lesion model to interrupt the flow of proprioceptive information to the brain through the dorsal column in wild-type animals. Using a custom-built treadmill, we administered sudden and random mechanical perturbations to mice during walking. External perturbations affected locomotion in wild-type mice similar to the absence of proprioceptors in genetically modified mice. Proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs contributed to locomotor robustness. Wild-type mice lost the ability to respond to external perturbations after interruption of the ascending proprioceptive projection to the brainstem.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent physiological data sets are often difficult to interpret objectively. Biosignals such as electromyogram, electroencephalogram, or single-neuron recordings can be interpreted using various linear and nonlinear methods. Each analysis technique aims at the explanation of different data features that might be visible or not to the naked eye. Here, we used linear decomposition based on machine learning to extract motor primitives (the time-dependent coefficients of muscle synergies) from the hindlimb electromyographic activity of mice during normal and mechanically perturbed locomotion. We set out to investigate the effects of calculation parameters and data quality on two nonlinear metrics derived from fractal analysis: the Higuchi{\textquoteright}s fractal dimension (HFD) and the Hurst exponent (H). Both HFD and H proved to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in motor primitives induced by external perturbations to locomotion. We discuss the potential pitfalls that might arise from fractal analysis by using examples based on surrogate data. We conclude giving some simple, data-driven suggestions to reduce the chance of misinterpretations when metrics such as HFD and H are applied to any biological signal containing elements of periodicity.

NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Despite the lack of consensus on how to perform fractal analysis of physiological time series, many studies rely on this technique. Here, we shed light on the potential pitfalls of using the Higuchi{\textquoteright}s fractal dimension and the Hurst exponent. We expose and suggest how to solve the drawbacks of such methods when applied to data from normal and perturbed locomotion by combining in vivo recordings and computational approaches.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Terrestrial locomotion is thought to be generated by the actions of a circuit of interconnected interneurons (central pattern generator) in the spinal cord that drive the patterned activity of pools of motor neurons, causing sequential contraction of dozens of leg muscles. Sensory feedback exerts a strong modulatory influence on this pattern; nevertheless, it remains unclear whether sensory feedback also plays a role in the generation of the normal locomotor pattern. Through the use of a combination of electrophysiology, behavior, and mouse genetics, we provide evidence that the absence of proprioceptive sensory feedback degrades locomotor pattern, indicating that proprioceptive feedback is required for the construction of locomotor pattern.
          , 
            Mammalian locomotor programs are thought to be directed by the actions of spinal interneuron circuits collectively referred to as {\textquotedblleft}central pattern generators.{\textquotedblright} The contribution of proprioceptive sensory feedback to the coordination of locomotor activity remains less clear. We have analyzed changes in mouse locomotor pattern under conditions in which proprioceptive feedback is attenuated genetically and biomechanically. We find that locomotor pattern degrades upon elimination of proprioceptive feedback from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs. The degradation of locomotor pattern is manifest as the loss of interjoint coordination and alternation of flexor and extensor muscles. Group Ia/II sensory feedback from muscle spindles has a predominant influence in patterning the activity of flexor muscles, whereas the redundant activities of group Ia/II and group Ib afferents appear to determine the pattern of extensor muscle firing. These findings establish a role for proprioceptive feedback in the control of fundamental aspects of mammalian locomotor behavior.},

Afferents from these mechanoreceptors project to neuronal networks controlling locomotion in the spinal cord and brain. The dynamic interactions between the control systems at different levels of the neuraxis ensure that locomotion adjusts to its environment and meets task demands. In this article, we describe and discuss the essential contribution of somatosensory feedback to locomotion. We start with a discussion of how biomechanical properties of the body affect somatosensory feedback. We follow with the different types of mechanoreceptors and somatosensory afferents and their activity during locomotion. We then describe central projections to locomotor networks and the modulation of somatosensory feedback during locomotion and its mechanisms. We then discuss experimental approaches and animal models used to investigate the control of locomotion by somatosensory feedback before providing an overview of the different functional roles of somatosensory feedback for locomotion. Lastly, we briefly describe the role of somatosensory feedback in the recovery of locomotion after neurological injury. We highlight the fact that somatosensory feedback is an essential component of a highly integrated system for locomotor control. {\textcopyright} 2021 American Physiological Society.

	abstract = {This letter describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the $\beta$-divergence ($\beta$-NMF). The $\beta$-divergence is a family of cost functions parameterized by a single shape parameter $\beta$ that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases ($\beta$ = 2, 1, 0 respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a $\beta$-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can, however, be proven for $\beta$ ? (0, 1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of the majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm, which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The letter also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF: penalized NMF (when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).},

@article{Ma2021,
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel muscle synergy extraction method based on multivariate curve resolution{\textendash}alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) to overcome the limitation of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method for extracting non-sparse muscle synergy, and we study its potential application for evaluating motor function of stroke survivors. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the most widely used method for muscle synergy extraction. However, NMF is susceptible to components{\textquoteright} sparseness and usually provides inferior reliability, which significantly limits the promotion of muscle synergy. In this study, MCR-ALS was employed to extract muscle synergy from electromyography (EMG) data. Its performance was compared with two other matrix factorization algorithms, NMF and self-modeling mixture analysis (SMMA). Simulated data sets were utilized to explore the influences of the sparseness and noise on the extracted synergies. As a result, the synergies estimated by MCR-ALS were the most similar to true synergies as compared with SMMA and NMF. MCR-ALS was used to analyze the muscle synergy characteristics of upper limb movements performed by healthy (n = 11) and stroke (n = 5) subjects. The repeatability and intra-subject consistency were used to evaluate the performance of MCR-ALS. As a result, MCR-ALS provided much higher repeatability and intra-subject consistency as compared with NMF, which were important for the reliability of the motor function evaluation. The stroke subjects had lower intra-subject consistency and seemingly had more synergies as compared with the healthy subjects. Thus, MCR-ALS is a promising muscle synergy analysis method for motor function evaluation of stroke patients.},

@article{Flaxman2021,
	abstract = {Objective
Externally applied abduction and rotational loads are major contributors to the knee joint injury mechanism; yet, how muscles work together to stabilize the knee against these loads remains unclear. Our study sought to evaluate lower limb functional muscle synergies in healthy young adults such that muscle activation can be directly related to internal knee joint moments.
Methods
Concatenated non-negative matrix factorization extracted muscle and moment synergies of 22 participants from electromyographic signals and joint moments elicited during a weight-bearing force matching protocol.
Results
Two synergy sets were extracted: Set 1 included four synergies, each corresponding to a general anterior, posterior, medial, or lateral force direction. Frontal and transverse moments were coupled during medial and lateral force directions. Set 2 included six synergies, each corresponding to a moment type (extension/flexion, ab/adduction, internal/external rotation). Hamstrings and quadriceps dominated synergies associated with respective flexion and extension moments while quadriceps-hamstring co-activation was associated with knee abduction. Rotation moments were associated with notable contributions from hamstrings, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, and hip ab/adductors, corresponding to a general co-activation muscle synergy.
Conclusion
Our results highlight the importance of muscular co-activation of all muscles crossing the knee to support it during injury-inducing loading conditions such as externally applied knee abduction and rotation. Functional muscle synergies can provide new insight into the relationship between neuromuscular control and knee joint stability by directly associating biomechanical variables to muscle activation.},

@article{Zhao2022,
	abstract = {Muscle synergies have been largely used in many application fields, including motor control studies, prosthesis control, movement classification, rehabilitation, and clinical studies. Due to the complexity of the motor control system, the full repertoire of the underlying synergies has been identified only for some classes of movements and scenarios. Several extraction methods have been used to extract muscle synergies. However, some of these methods may not effectively capture the nonlinear relationship between muscles and impose constraints on input signals or extracted synergies. Moreover, other approaches such as autoencoders (AEs), an unsupervised neural network, were recently introduced to study bioinspired control and movement classification. In this study, we evaluated the performance of five methods for the extraction of spatial muscle synergy, namely, principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), factor analysis (FA), nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), and AEs using simulated data and a publicly available database. To analyze the performance of the considered extraction methods with respect to several factors, we generated a comprehensive set of simulated data (ground truth), including spatial synergies and temporal coefficients. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of channels (NoC) varied when generating simulated data to evaluate their effects on ground truth reconstruction. This study also tested the efficacy of each synergy extraction method when coupled with standard classification methods, including K-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). The results showed that both SNR and NoC affected the outputs of the muscle synergy analysis. Although AEs showed better performance than FA in variance accounted for and PCA in synergy vector similarity and activation coefficient similarity, NMF and ICA outperformed the other three methods. Classification tasks showed that classification algorithms were sensitive to synergy extraction methods, while KNN and RF outperformed the other two methods for all extraction methods; in general, the classification accuracy of NMF and PCA was higher. Overall, the results suggest selecting suitable methods when performing muscle synergy-related analysis.},

	abstract = {The muscle synergy concept provides a widely-accepted paradigm to break down the complexity of motor control. In order to identify the synergies, different matrix factorisation techniques have been used in a repertoire of fields such as prosthesis control and biomechanical and clinical studies. However, the relevance of these matrix factorisation techniques is still open for discussion since there is no ground truth for the underlying synergies. Here, we evaluate factorisation techniques and investigate the factors that affect the quality of estimated synergies. We compared commonly used matrix factorisation methods: Principal component analysis (PCA), Independent component analysis (ICA), Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and second-order blind identification (SOBI). Publicly available real data were used to assess the synergies extracted by each factorisation method in the classification of wrist movements. Synthetic datasets were utilised to explore the effect of muscle synergy sparsity, level of noise and number of channels on the extracted synergies. Results suggest that the sparse synergy model and a higher number of channels would result in better estimated synergies. Without dimensionality reduction, SOBI showed better results than other factorisation methods. This suggests that SOBI would be an alternative when a limited number of electrodes is available but its performance was still poor in that case. Otherwise, NMF had the best performance when the number of channels was higher than the number of synergies. Therefore, NMF would be the best method for muscle synergy extraction.},

	abstract = {We investigated the influence of three different high-pass (HP) and low-pass (LP) filtering conditions and a Gaussian (GNMF) and inverse-Gaussian (IGNMF) non-negative matrix factorization algorithm on the extraction of muscle synergies from myoelectric signals during human walking and running. To evaluate the effects of signal recording and processing on the outcomes, we analyzed the intraday and interday computation reliability. Results show that the IGNMF achieved a significantly higher reconstruction quality and on average needs one less synergy to sufficiently reconstruct the original signals compared to the GNMF. For both factorizations, the HP with a cut-off frequency of 250
Hz significantly reduces the number of synergies. We identified the filter configuration of fourth order, HP 50
Hz and LP 20
Hz as the most suitable to minimize the combination of fundamental synergies, providing a higher reliability across all filtering conditions even if HP 250
Hz is excluded. Defining a fundamental synergy as a single-peaked activation pattern, for walking and running we identified five and six fundamental synergies, respectively using both algorithms. The variability in combined synergies produced by different filtering conditions and factorization methods on the same data set suggests caution when attributing a neurophysiological nature to the combined synergies.},

	abstract = {The motor modules during human walking are identified using non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) from surface electromyography (EMG) signals. The extraction of motor modules in healthy participants is affected by the change in pre-processing of EMG signals, such as low-pass filters (LPFs); however, the effect of different pre-processing methods, such as the number of necessary gait cycles (GCs) in post-stroke patients with varying steps, remains unknown. We aimed to specify that the number of GCs influenced the motor modules extracted in the consideration of LPFs in post-stroke patients. In total, 10 chronic post-stroke patients walked at a self-selected speed on an overground walkway, while EMG signals were recorded from the eight muscles of paretic lower limb. To verify the number of GCs, five GC conditions were set, namely, 25 (reference condition), 20, 15, 10, and 5 gate cycles with three LPFs (4, 10, and 15 Hz). First, the number of modules, variability accounted for (VAF), and muscle weightings extracted by the NNMF algorithm were compared between the conditions. Next, a modified NNMF algorithm, in which the activation timing profiles among different GCs were unified, was performed to compare the muscle weightings more robustly between GCs. The number of motor modules was not significantly different, regardless of the GCs. The difference in VAF and muscle weightings in the different GCs decreased with the LPF of 4 Hz. Muscle weightings in 15 GCs or less were significantly different from those in 25 GCs using the modified NNMF. Therefore, we concluded that the variability extracted motor modules by different GCs was suppressed with lower LPFs; however, 20 GCs were needed for more representative extraction of motor modules during walking in post-stroke patients.},

Commissural pathways coordinating the activities of spinal locomotor circuits during locomotion have been characterized in mice, but their relationship to crossed reflexes is unknown. We show the involvement of two genetically distinct groups of commissural interneurons (CINs) described in mice, V0 and V3 CINs, in the crossed reflex pathways. Our data suggest that the exclusively excitatory V3 CINs are directly involved in the excitatory crossed reflexes and show that they are essential for the inhibitory crossed reflexes. In contrast, the V0 CINs, a population that includes excitatory and inhibitory CINs, are not directly involved in excitatory or inhibitory crossed reflexes but downregulate the inhibitory crossed reflexes. Our data provide insights into the spinal circuitry underlying crossed reflexes in mice, describing the roles of V0 and V3 CINs in crossed reflexes.},

@article{Wood2023,
	abstract = {Background
Lower limb proprioception is critical for maintaining stability during gait and may impact how individuals modify their movements in response to changes in the environment and body state, a process termed {\textquotedblleft}sensorimotor adaptation{\textquotedblright}. However, the connection between lower limb proprioception and sensorimotor adaptation during human gait has not been established. We suspect this gap is due in part to the lack of reliable, efficient methods to assess global lower limb proprioception in an ecologically valid context.
New Method
We assessed static lower limb proprioception using an alternative forced choice task, administered twice to determine test-retest reliability. Participants stood on a dual-belt treadmill which passively moved one limb to stimulus locations selected by a Bayesian adaptive algorithm. At the stimulus locations, participants judged relative foot positions and the algorithm estimated the point of subjective equality (PSE) and the uncertainty of lower limb proprioception.
Results
Using the Bland-Altman method, combined with Bayesian statistics, we found that both the PSE and uncertainty estimates had good reliability.
Comparison with existing method(s)
Current methods assessing static lower limb proprioception do so within a single joint, in non-weight bearing positions, and rely heavily on memory. One exception assessed static lower limb proprioception in standing but did not measure reliability and contained confounds impacting participants{\textquoteright} judgments, which we experimentally controlled here.
Conclusions
This efficient and reliable method assessing lower limb proprioception will aid future mechanistic understanding of locomotor adaptation and serve as a useful tool for basic and clinical researchers studying balance and falls.},

@article{Bruijn2012,
	abstract = {Human walking is highly adaptable, which allows us to walk under different circumstances. With aging, the probability of falling increases, which may partially be due to a decreased ability of older adults to adapt the gait pattern to the needs of the environment. The literature on visuomotor adaptations during reaching suggests, however, that older adults have little problems in adapting their motor behavior. Nevertheless, it may be that adaptation during a more complex task like gait is compromised by aging. In this study, we investigated the ability of young (n = 8) and older (n = 12) adults to adapt their gait pattern to novel constraints with a split-belt paradigm. Findings revealed that older adults adapted less and more slowly to split-belt walking and showed fewer aftereffects than young adults. While young adults showed a fast adjustment of the relative time spent in swing for each leg older adults failed to do so, but instead they were very fast in manipulating swing speed differences between the two legs. We suggest that these changes in adaptability of gait due to aging stem from a mild degradation of cortico-cerebellar pathways (reduced adaptability) and cerebral structures (decreased ability to change gait cycle timing). However, an alternative interpretation may be that the observed reduced adaptation is a compensatory strategy in view of the instability induced by the split-belt paradigm.},

	abstract = {We studied 12 peripheral neuropathy patients (PNP) and 13 age-matched controls with the {\textquotedblleft}broken escalator{\textquotedblright} paradigm to see how somatosensory loss affects gait adaptation and the release and recovery ({\textquotedblleft}braking{\textquotedblright}) of the forward trunk overshoot observed during this locomotor aftereffect. Trunk displacement, foot contact signals, and leg electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded while subjects walked onto a stationary sled (BEFORE trials), onto the moving sled (MOVING or adaptation trials), and again onto the stationary sled (AFTER trials). PNP were unsteady during the MOVING trials, but this progressively improved, indicating some adaptation. During the after trials, 77\% of control subjects displayed a trunk overshoot aftereffect but over half of the PNP (58\%) did not. The PNP without a trunk aftereffect adapted to the MOVING trials by increasing distance traveled; subsequently this was expressed as increased distance traveled during the aftereffect rather than as a trunk overshoot. This clear separation in consequent aftereffects was not seen in the normal controls suggesting that, as a result of somatosensory loss, some PNP use distinctive strategies to negotiate the moving sled, in turn resulting in a distinct aftereffects. In addition, PNP displayed earlier than normal anticipatory leg EMG activity during the first after trial. Although proprioceptive inputs are not critical for the emergence or termination of the aftereffect, somatosensory loss induces profound changes in motor adaptation and anticipation. Our study has found individual differences in adaptive motor performance, indicative that PNP adopt different feed-forward gait compensatory strategies in response to peripheral sensory loss.},

@article{Martino2014,
	abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated how cerebellar ataxia (CA) affects gait, resulting in deficits in multijoint coordination and stability. Nevertheless, how lesions of cerebellum influence the locomotor muscle pattern generation is still unclear. To better understand the effects of CA on locomotor output, here we investigated the idiosyncratic features of the spatiotemporal structure of leg muscle activity and impairments in the biomechanics of CA gait. To this end, we recorded the electromyographic (EMG) activity of 12 unilateral lower limb muscles and analyzed kinematic and kinetic parameters of 19 ataxic patients and 20 age-matched healthy subjects during overground walking. Neuromuscular control of gait in CA was characterized by a considerable widening of EMG bursts and significant temporal shifts in the center of activity due to overall enhanced muscle activation between late swing and mid-stance. Patients also demonstrated significant changes in the intersegmental coordination, an abnormal transient in the vertical ground reaction force and instability of limb loading at heel strike. The observed abnormalities in EMG patterns and foot loading correlated with the severity of pathology [International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS), a clinical ataxia scale] and the changes in the biomechanical output. The findings provide new insights into the physiological role of cerebellum in optimizing the duration of muscle activity bursts and the control of appropriate foot loading during locomotion.},
